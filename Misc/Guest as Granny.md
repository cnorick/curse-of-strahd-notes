Firstly, try to play Morgantha as the most loving, grandmotherly person in the whole wide world. She's kind to a fault and a shameless gossip (as many elder women can be as a stereotype).

Morgantha introduces herself as Granny, If asked for her name, Morgantha replies honestly, but shows distaste for it. She says:
>Why it's Morgantha, dear. But everyone just calls me Granny. Morgantha is much too formal!

Granny sells pastries and pies for 1 Gold each.

If the players ask why her wares are so expensive she tells the PCs that it's a bit of magic her mother taught her.

The pies bring the eaters only the sweetest dreams, something poorly lacking in this dreary world. She is visibly upset when she says this, honestly seeming grief stricken at the sorry state of the world.

Granny's pastries are made from a variety of ingredients, meat pie, onion pie, pumpkin pie etc (this is what Granny has, not what you should make ;-)

If players ask what kind of meat is in the pies. Morgantha says something like:
>Oh, Barovians use all kinds of meat. Especially since we've a dreadful lack of sunlight for good fruits and veggies. I myself prefer chicken, but there's also goat, deer, pig, and wolf meat depending on where you go. You'd think wolf meat would be more of delicacy, huh? Not here, dearie! With Lord Strahd in charge there's more wolves in these woods than we know what to do with!

Don’t try to read the following verbatim, they are just talking points if things get slow and you need to improvise. Granny’s primary goal is to move her pies.

*definitely share info about the tavern*.

## Things Granny might share:

- __The Blood of The Vine Tavern__, in the center of town, is a good place to get a room and some wine, but the food is tasteless, their chef is a soulless hack who couldn’t boil a turnip if Mother Night herself were in the dining room.
- If the players ask “where are we?” or something like that
	- Granny answers that we are in the land of Barovia, ruled by Lord Strahd Von Zarovich. Granny is reluctant to talk about Strahd too much and if the players press her on the issue, granny becomes uncomfortable and changes the subject back to her pies.
- If the players ask how they might **leave Barovia**
	- Granny answers with great sadness:

> that none may pass the mists that enshrine this land, there is no wall that is higher and no sea more vast than the mists that imprison us all here. Although, it is rumored that some Vistani have the ability to pass through the mists because of an ancient pact.

- The Burgomaster of The Village of Barovia, Kolyan Indirovich, died recently, leaving a son and daughter, both adults
	- Granny knows that the son Ismark will likely take over as Burgomaster, but will confide that she believes Ireena to be better suited to leadership.
- Mary Swilova's daughter, Gertruda, recently went missing
    - Mary is a bit of a nutter. She kept Gertruda locked away in that house for her entire life. Many people didn’t even know Mary had a daughter. But a few days ago Gertruda, now a teenager, sneaked out and hasn’t been seen since.
- Granny might ask male PCs why on earth they haven't settled down yet and asks the female PCs why they're so skinny. They should get some meat on their bones, for goodness sake!

No matter what, Morgantha will gift the party with a pie to share for dinner. Yes, they normally cost 1gp, but she is confident that they’ll be back for more and she wouldn’t want such lovely people to have to choke down the gruel and shoe leather they serve at the tavern.

## Granny at the Windmill
**All of this is secret so** 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫

Basically, here's the truth about Morgantha (Granny). She's part of a witch coven with her two daughters [[Bella Sunbane]] and [[Offalia Wormwiggle]]. As a coven, they get extra powers. They all three specialize in making Dream Pies (the ones she sold the party back in Barovia Village), and their whole operation is run from this windmill.

As we already know about the pies, they have addictive qualities, but they also actually do make their eater feel a little better for a short time. And there are many people in Barovia that keep the hags in business.

Here's the kicker (in 2 parts):
1. There's a secret ingredient to these magic pies: children bones. The hags actually have some kids in cages in the windmill whose bones they hope to harvest soon. And when they do get the bones, they actually use the old mill upstairs to grind them into a powder before putting them into the pies.
2. Once people get addicted to the pies and really need them, some with no remaining money are actually desperate enough to trade their own children to Morgantha in exchange for more pies.


### Playing Morgantha at the Windmill
At some point while the characters are at the windmill, Granny will make another appearance. They'll probably start off the sessions talking with the daughters at the windmill. But there is a really good chance, given their experience already with the pies, that they'll get into a fight.
