## Handout
_Staff, rare (requires attunement)_

Made from the branch of a [[Gulthias tree]], a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood from which ashen smoke wisps at a constant rate. It has a strangely spongy texture, and leaves behind a bloody residue on one's hand when touched. If squeezed, blood oozes from its pores. If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the screams immediately wither and die.

**Blight Bane.** A character that has attuned to the staff has the ability to command blights around them of CR 2 or below using simple, one-word commands. While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don’t regard you as hostile unless you harm them.

**Sower of Corruption.** The Gulthias staff has 5 charges. As an action, its wielder can expend charges to create any of the following creatures:
- 1 charge: 1x Twig Blight
- 2 charges: 1x Needle Blight
- 4 charges: 1x Vine Blight

When all charges are expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust without releasing its blight-killing shriek. Otherwise, it regains 1d4 charges each dawn.

## Secrets

**Vampiric Hunger.** The Gulthias staff draws its power from the blood of its wielder, extending tiny black roots into the veins beneath the owner's skin. For each day that a character is attuned to it, that character must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 necrotic damage on a failure. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target destroys or unattunes from the Gulthias staff and finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.


- If the branch is cut or broken, it positively weeps blood, possibly leaving a rather grotesque spatter in the surrounding area.
- Nightmares
    - Anyone attuned to the staff has vivid nightmares/visions of the Gulthias Tree each and every night. They will dream of nothing else.
