Dangers abound in the land of Barovia. Check for a random encounter after every 30 minutes that the adventurers spend on the roads or in the wilderness (don't check if they have already had two random encounters outdoors in the past 12 hours):

- If the characters are on a road, an encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher on a d20.
- If the characters are in the wilderness, an encounter occurs on a roll of 15 or higher on a d20.

If an encounter occurs, roll on the daytime or the nighttime encounter table, depending on the time, or have Strahd's spies appear (see the "[Strahd's Spies](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,3,strahd's%20spies,0)" sidebar).

Use the descriptions that follow to help run each random encounter. The table entries are presented in alphabetical order.

### Barovian Commoners

>The sound of snapping twigs draws your attention to several dark shapes in the fog. They carry torches and pitchforks.

If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from these Barovians, who carry pitchforks (+2 to hit) instead of clubs, dealing 3 (1d6) piercing damage on a hit.

[Barovian commoners](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#barovian%20commoner_cos) rarely leave their settlements. This group might be a family looking for a safer place to live, or an angry mob searching for the characters or heading toward Castle Ravenloft to confront Strahd.

```statblock
monster: Commoner
```

### Barovian Scouts

If at least one character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, read:

>You see a dark figure crouched low and perfectly still, aiming a crossbow in your direction.

If more than one scout is present, the others are spread out over a 100-foot-square area.

>These [[Scout]] are Barovian hunters or trappers searching for a missing villager or townsperson. Once they realize the characters aren't out to kill them, they lower their weapons and request help in finding their missing person. If the characters decline, the scouts point them in the direction of the nearest settlement and depart without so much as a farewell. They wield light crossbows (+4 to hit, range 80/320 ft.) instead of longbows, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage on a hit.

```statblock
monster: Scout
```

#### Strahd's Spies

As the undisputed master of Barovia, Strahd has many spies, from swarms of bats to wandering Vistani, who report to him at dawn and dusk each day. These agents constantly patrol the land of Barovia and report everything they see to him.

Every day and night that the characters remain in Barovia, one or more of the vampire's spies check on them and attempt to return to Strahd with a report. When a spy appears, characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score equal to or greater than the spy's Dexterity (Stealth) check notice it. A spy does not constitute an encounter if the characters are unaware of its presence. If they do notice it, the spy's goal is usually escape, not combat. A secondary goal for a spy might be to acquire some physical object—a possession, an article of clothing, or even some part of a character's body such as a lock of hair—that Strahd can use to improve the efficacy of his [[Scrying]] spell. If one of Strahd's spies is confronted by the party, the spy attempts to grab some accessible item from a character before fleeing. If Strahd acquires such an item, he uses his [[Scrying]] spell to learn as much as he can about the party before planning his next attack, and to verify what his spies have already told him.

### Berserkers

These wild mountain folk are covered head to toe in thick gray mud, which makes them hard to see in the fog and well hidden in the mountains they call home. While so camouflaged, they have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores are higher than the berserker's Dexterity (Stealth) check can spot the nearest [[Berserker]].

If someone spots the berserker, read:

>You startle a wild-looking figure caked in gray mud and clutching a crude stone axe. Whether it's a man or a woman, you can't tell.

The berserkers shun civilized folk. They try to remain hidden and withdraw if they are spotted, attacking only if trapped or threatened.

```statblock
monster: Berserker
```

### Corpse

This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.

>You find a corpse.

Roll a d6 to determine the nature of the corpse:

- 1–2. The corpse belonged to a wolf killed by spears and crossbow bolts.
    
- 3–5. The corpse belongs to a Barovian man, woman, or child who was clearly torn to pieces by dire wolves. If the party is accompanied by Barovian scouts ([[#Barovian Scouts]]), the scouts recognize the corpse as the person they were searching for.
    
- 6. The corpse looks like one of the characters (determined randomly) but has been stripped of armor, weapons, and valuables. If moved, its flesh melts away until only the skeleton remains.
    

### Dire Wolves

> A snarling wolf the size of a grizzly bear steps out of the fog.

The area is lightly obscured by fog. If more than one dire wolf is present, the others aren't far behind and can be seen as dark shadows in the fog. The [[Dire Wolf]] of Barovia are cruel, overgrown wolves and Strahd's loyal servants. They can't be [[Conditions#Charmed]] or [[Conditions#Frightened]].

```statblock
monster: Dire Wolf
```

### Druid and Twig Blights

([[Forest Folk]])

>A gaunt figure with wild hair and bare feet bounds toward you on all fours, wearing a tattered gown of stitched animal skins. You can't tell whether it's a man or a woman. It stops, sniffs the air, and laughs like a lunatic. The ground nearby is crawling with tiny twig monsters.

The Barovian wilderness is home to [[Forest Folk]] who worship Strahd because of his ability to control the weather and the beasts of Barovia. The druids are savage and violent, and each controls a host of [[Twig Blight Statblock|Twig Blights]], which fights until destroyed. If all the twig blights are destroyed or the druid loses more than half of its hit points, the druid flees, heading toward [[Yester Hill (Y)|Yester Hill]].

```statblock
creature: Druid
```

```statblock
creature: Twig Blight
```

### False Trail

This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.

>You discover a foot trail that cuts through the wilderness.

Evil druids left this trail. Following it in either direction leads to a [[Situational Rules#Pits|Spiked Pit]] spiked pit. A thin tarp made of twigs and pine needles conceals the pit, the bottom of which is lined with sharpened wooden stakes.

### Ghost

>A baleful apparition appears before you, its hollow eyes dark with anger.

Many ghosts haunt this land. This particular ghost is all that remains of a person drained of life by Strahd (decide whether it's a man or a woman). It appears and hisses, "No one will ever know you died here." It then attacks. If the [[Ghost]] succeeds in possessing a character, it leads its host to the gates of [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Ravenloft]] and hurls the host's body into the chasm.

```statblock
creature: Ghost
```

### Grave

This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.

>You stumble upon an old grave.

There is a 25 percent chance that the grave is intact, appearing as an elongated earthen mound or a rocky cairn. Characters who dig up the grave find the skeletal remains of a human clad in rusted chain mail (a soldier). Among the bones lie corroded weapons.

If the grave isn't intact, it has been violated. The characters find a shallow, mud-filled hole with dirt or rocks strewn around it and a few scattered bones within.

### Hidden Bundle

This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.

The characters find a leather-wrapped bundle hidden in the underbrush, stuffed inside a hollow log, or nestled in the boughs of a tree. If they open the bundle, read:

>The bundle contains one set of common clothes sized for a human adult.

The [[reference/Adventuring Gear|clothes]] have a drab Barovian style to them. They belong to a wereraven or werewolf.

### Hunting Trap

This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.

Have each of the characters in the front rank of the party's marching order make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. If one or more of them succeeds, read:

>You spot a wolf trap, its steel jaws caked with rust. Someone has carefully hidden the trap under a thin layer of pine needles and detritus.

Barovian hunters and trappers set these traps hoping to thin out the wolf population, but Strahd's wolves are too clever to be caught in them. If none of the characters in the front rank spots the hidden trap, one random party member steps on it. Rules for the [[reference/Adventuring Gear|hunting trap]] are presented in chapter 5, "[Equipment](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,5)," of the [Player's Handbook](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB).

### Needle Blights

>Hunched figures lurch through the mist, their gaunt bodies covered in needles.

The woods crawl with [[Needle Blight Statblock|Needle Blights]] that serve the evil druids of Barovia. If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from these blights.

```statblock
creature: Needle Blight
```

### Revenant

>A figure walks alone with the stride and bearing of one who knows no fear. Clad in rusty armor, it clutches a gleaming longsword in its pale hand and looks ready for a fight.

From a distance, the [[Revenant Statblock|Revenant]] looks like a zombie and might be mistaken for such. A character within 30 feet of the revenant who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can see the intelligence and hate in its sunken eyes. The revenant is clad in tattered chain mail that affords the same protection as leather armor.

The revenant was a knight of [[The Order of the Silver Dragon]], which was annihilated defending the valley against Strahd's armies more than four centuries ago. The revenant no longer remembers its name and wanders the land in search of Strahd's wolves and other minions, slaying them on sight. If the characters attack it, the revenant assumes they are in league with Strahd and fights them until destroyed.

As an action, the revenant can attack twice with its longsword, wielding the weapon with both hands and dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage on each hit.

If the characters present themselves as enemies of Strahd, the revenant urges them to travel to [[Argynvostholt (Q)|Argynvostholt]] and convince [[Vladimir Horngaard]] the leader of [[The Order of the Silver Dragon]], to help them. The revenant would like nothing more than to kill Strahd, but it will not venture to Castle Ravenloft unless it receives orders to do so from [[Vladimir Horngaard|Vlad]]. If the characters ask the revenant to lead them to Horngaard in Argynvostholt, it does so while avoiding contact with Barovian settlements.

```statblock
creature: Revenant
```

### Scarecrows

If at least one character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher, read:

>A scarecrow lurches into view. Its sackcloth eyes and rictus are ripe with malevolence, and its gut is stuffed with dead ravens. It has long, rusted knives for claws.

If more than one [[Scarecrow Statblock|scarecrow]] is present, the others are close by. If none of the characters has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher, the scarecrows catch the party by surprise.

[[Baba Lysaga]] (see [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]]) crafted these scarecrows to hunt down and kill ravens and wereravens. The scarecrows are imbued with evil spirits and delight in murdering anyone they encounter.

```statblock
creature: Scarecrow
```

### Skeletal Rider

>Through the mist comes a skeletal warhorse and rider, both clad in ruined chainmail. The skeletal rider holds up a rusted lantern that sheds no light.

The human [[Skeletons|skeleton]] and [warhorse skeleton](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#warhorse%20skeleton_mm) are all that remain of a rider and mount, both of whom perished trying to escape through the fog that surrounds Barovia. They are doomed to ride through the valley in search of another way out, without hope of salvation. The skeletons ignore the characters unless attacked.

If both the rider and its mount are destroyed, this encounter can't occur again. The destruction of one skeleton doesn't prevent future encounters with the other.

```statblock
creature: Skeleton
```

```statblock
creature: Warhorse Skeleton
```

### Strahd Zombies

>Not even the cloying fog can hide the stench of death that descends upon you. Something evil approaches, its footsteps betrayed by snapping twigs.

If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from the [[Strahd Zombie Statblock|Strahd Zombies]]. These undead soldiers once served as guards in Castle Ravenloft. They fled the castle after Strahd became a vampire but couldn't avoid their master's wrath. They still wear bits of tattered livery, and they attack the living on sight.

```statblock
monster: Strahd Zombie
```

### Swarms of Bats

>The stillness of the night is shattered by the shriek of bats and the flapping of tiny black wings.

These [[Bat|bats]] are the servants of Strahd. They attack the characters without provocation.

```statblock
monster: Swarm of Bats
```

### Swarms of Ravens

>Your presence in this dreary land has not gone unnoticed. A raven follows you for several minutes while keeping a respectful distance.

The raven doesn't caw or try to communicate with the characters. If they leave it alone, read:

>More ravens begin to take an interest in you. Before long, their numbers swell, and soon hundreds of them are watching you.

The ravens fly away if attacked. If they are left alone, they watch over the party, remaining with the characters until they reach Castle Ravenloft or a settlement. If the characters have a random encounter with hostile creatures, the [[Swarm of Ravens]] aid the characters by attacking and distracting their enemies.

```statblock
creature: Swarm of Ravens
```

### Trinket

>You find something on the ground.

A random character finds a lost trinket. Roll on the [Trinkets table](https://5e.tools/items.html#trinket_cos) in [appendix A](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#CoS,18), select a specific trinket from the table, or create one on the fly.

### Vistani Bandits

>You catch a whiff of pipe smoke in the cold air and hear laughter through the fog.

These [[Vistani]]  march through the Barovian wilderness, laughing and telling ghost stories. They are searching for graves to plunder or hunting small game. For a price of 100 gp, they offer to serve as guides. As long as these Vistani are with the party, roll a d12 instead of a d12 + d8 when determining random encounters in the wilderness. In addition, wolves and dire wolves don't threaten the characters as long as the Vistani are traveling with them and aren't their prisoners.

Treasure. 

One Vistani bandit carries a pouch that holds 2d4 small gemstones (worth 50 gp each).

### Wereraven

This [[Wereraven Statblock|wereraven]] in raven form watches the characters from a distance. Compare its Dexterity (Stealth) check result to the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to see whether it remains hidden from the party.

If one or more characters spot the creature, read:

>Through the mist, you see a black bird circling overhead. When it feels your eyes upon it, the raven flies away, but it's back before long, keeping its distance.

The wereraven belongs to a secret order called the Keepers of the Feather. If the characters don't spot it, the wereraven shadows them for 1d4 hours. At the end of that time, or anytime sooner if the characters attack it, the creature flies home to report what it has seen.

If the party has a second random encounter with a wereraven, this one presents itself to the characters as an ally and requests that they travel to the [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Blue Water Inn (N2)|Blue Water Inn in Vallaki]] to meet "some new friends." It then flies off in the direction of the town.

### Werewolves

If the werewolves are in human form, read:

>A deep voice calls out, "Who goes there?" Through the chill mist you see a large man in drab clothing wearing a tattered gray cloak. He has shaggy, black hair and thick muttonchops. He leans heavily on a spear and has a small bundle of animal pelts slung over his shoulder.

If the werewolves are in wolf form, read:

>You hear the howl of a wolf some distance away.

How the werewolves act depends on the form they have taken.

*Human Form.* 

Werewolves in human form pretend to be trappers. If more than one is present, the others are within whistling distance.

They try to befriend the characters to see if they are carrying silvered weapons. If the characters appear to have no such weapons, the werewolves assume hybrid form and attack. Otherwise, they part company with the characters and leave well enough alone.

*Wolf Form.* 

Werewolves in wolf form follow the party from a safe distance for several hours. If their Dexterity (Stealth) checks exceed the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, the werewolves attack with surprise when the characters decide to take a short or long rest. Otherwise, they wait until the characters are weakened by another random encounter before moving in for the easy kill.

The werewolves' lair is a cave complex that overlooks Lake Baratok ([[Werewolf Den (Z)|Werewolf Den]]) If you used the "[Werewolves in the Mist](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,2,werewolves%20in%20the%20mist,0)" adventure hook to lure the characters to Barovia, captured werewolves can be forced to divulge the location of their den, where they keep their prisoners.

```statblock
monster: Werewolf
```

### Will-o'-Wisp

This random encounter occurs only once. If it comes up again, treat the result as no encounter.

>Several hundred yards away, through the fog, you see a flickering torchlight.

If the characters follow the flickering light, read:

>The torchlight flutters as it moves away from you, but you never lose sight of it. You make your way quickly yet cautiously through the fog until you come upon the shell of a ruined tower. The upper floors of the structure have collapsed, leaving heaps of rubble and shattered timber around the tower's base. The feeble light moves through an open doorway on the ground floor, then flickers and goes out.

The light is a [[Will-o-Wisp]] that enters the ruined tower and becomes [[Conditions#Invisible]], hoping to lure the characters inside to their doom.

The floor of the tower is made of packed earth. Its interior is [desecrated ground](https://5e.tools/trapshazards.html#desecrated%20ground_dmg) (see "[Wilderness Hazards](https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,5,wilderness%20hazards,0)" in chapter 5 of the [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG)). Against the inside wall of the tower, across from the open doorway, is a closed, empty wooden chest.

If the characters disturb the chest, 3d6 [[Zombies]] erupt from the earthen floor and attack. Once the zombies appear, the will-o'-wisp becomes visible and joins the fray.

```statblock
monster: Will-o'-Wisp
```

```statblock
monster: Zombie
```

### Wolves

>This land is home to many wolves, their howls at the moment too close for comfort.

Characters have a few minutes to steel themselves before these [[Wolf|wolves]] attack. They heed the will of Strahd and can't be [[Conditions#Charmed]] or [[Conditions#Frightened]].

```statblock
creature: Wolf
```

### Zombies

>The ungodly stench of rotting flesh hangs in the air. Up ahead, the walking, moaning corpses of dead men and women lumber about.

These unfortunate Barovians fell prey to the evils of the land and now shamble from place to place as a [[Zombies|ravenous mob]].

```statblock
monster: Zombie
```
