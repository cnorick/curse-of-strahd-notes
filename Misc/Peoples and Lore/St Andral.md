## Strahd's Monologue

You fools. You poor witless sorry things. Andral? I knew Andral. These people call him protector, ‘saint’?  Laughable. Andral was neither of these things. Traitor, that is his legacy.

Andral was one of mine. A commander. One of the castle guards of Ravenloft. I gave him his position, through my leadership he attained glory, and then, the day that I chose great power, he chose weakness and betrayal. He dared to strike at me, and was the first to learn that I would never die, no matter the wounds.

The coward fled, with a handful of other traitors, coming to this poor excuse for a settlement. Andral, and those that defied me, fled to his house, on this very ground, where he hid like a coward, refusing entry to me, his lord and commander, and to my servants as well. Of course, I am a patient and gracious lord, so I never violated the host’s rights within his own home. The poor fools lived there for how long, eating rats, vegetables from their sorry pots and planters, and who knows, perhaps eventually each other….

- If in the church, father lucian is huddled in the corner and says:
	- “That is not so… they were pure until the end... “ you hear Father Lucian mutter.

Now these people worship him! A traitor! A coward! His remains have continued to defy me, as this church was raised around the site of his house. But I cannot allow this farce to continue. I have been patient with this matter for centuries. As for host’s rights… ( \[if in church] as you have said, Father, ‘All are welcome’ here) ... Now, I will destroy these relics, and the people of Barovia will remember the _Feast of Andral_ as is right and proper, as I have commanded.

- if in church:
	- Father Lucian will hold up his holy symbol, but Strahd’s voice will ring out, echoing off the stone walls: "Your faith fails you father. It is as feeble as you are."

- A 20-foot ball of fire engulfs the bag of bones, immediately obliterating them and you are forced to look away from the inferno's blinding brilliance.
- the light fades and...
