## Vistani Lore
### [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]
- Strahd comes from a royal bloodline
	- He died centuries ago yet endures as one of the undead, feasting on the blood of the living
	- Barovians refer to him as "the devil Strahd"
- Strahd has taken many consorts, but he has known only one true love: a Barovian peasant girl named [[Tatyana]]. ( the Vistani don't know what happened to her)
- Strahd named the castle, [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Ravenloft]], after his beloved mother, [[Queen Ravenovia]]
	- Strangers aren't welcomed at the castle without an invite
 
### The Land of Barovia
- Strahd conquered this land centuries ago and named it after his father [[King Barov]]
	- Strahd uses wolves, bats, and other creatures to spy on all of his realm
- Barovians are simple, frightened people
	- Some have old souls, but many do not
	- The soulless ones are easy to spot, for they know nothing but fear
	- They have no charm, hope, or spark, and they don't cry
 - The [[Old Svalich Road]] passes through Strahd's domain
	 - Three settlements lie on the road like beads on a string
		 - [[Krezk (S)]] to the west
		 - [[Vallaki]] in the heart of the valley
		 - [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia]] to the east
		 - Strahd has spies in each settlement
- There's an old windmill ([[Old Bonegrinder (O)]]) on the road between the [[Village of Barovia (E)]] and  the town of [[Vallaki]]
	- It should be avoided at all costs! (They refuse to say more)
- It is wise to stick to the road
	- Wild druids, wayward ghosts, and packs of wolves and werewolves haunt the [[Svalich Woods (C)]]

### Beliefs and Superstitions
- The souls of those who die in Barovia can't escape to the afterlife
	- They are prisoners of Strahd's domain
- Some Vistani women are blessed with prescience
	- Of all the great Vistani fortune-tellers, none compares to [[Madam Eva]]
	- If knowledge of the future is what you seek, [[Madam Eva]] will tell you your fate
- A prescient Vistana can't see her own future or the future of another Vistana
	- It is the burden of the Vistani's great gift that their own fates can't be divined
- Vistani curses are potent, but they are invoked with great caution
- Vistani know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave consequences for the one who utters such a curse
- Ravens carry lost souls within them, so killing one is bad luck. (The ravens don't carry lost sols within)

## Vistani Curses
A Vistana, regardless of age, can use an action to utter a curse. The curse targets another creature within 30 feet that the Vistana can see. The Vistana can't utter another such curse before finishing a long rest. The curse is a repayment for an injustice or a slight.
- The target must succeed on a **DC 8 + <the Vistana's proficiency bonus> + <the Vistana's Charisma modifier> Wisdom saving throw** or become cursed
- The curse lasts until ended with a **greater restoration spell**, or similar magic
	- It doesn't end when the target dies
	- If a cursed target is returned to life, the curse remains in effect
	- When the curse ends, the Vistana suffers a harmful psychic backlash
	- The amount of this psychic damage depends on the severity of the curse that was invoked
- The Vistana chooses the curse's effect from the options that follow; other Vistani curses are possible. All such effects deal psychic damage to the Vistani who uttered them when they end:  

1. The target is unable to perform a certain kind of act involving fine motor control, such as tying knots, writ­ing, playing an instrument, sewing, or casting spells that have somatic components. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes **1d6 psychic damage**
2. The target's appearance changes in a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar on the target's face, turn the target's teeth into yellow fangs, or give the target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana it takes **1d6 psychic damage**
3. The target gains vulnerability to a damage type of the Vistana's choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes **3d6 psychic damage**.
4. The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws tied to one ability score of the Vistana's choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes **3d6 psychic damage**
5. The target's attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM) ends, and the target can't attune to the cho­sen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes **5d6 psychic damage**
6. The target is blinded, deafened, or both. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes **5d6 psychic damage**

## Evil Eye
-  As an action, a Vistana can target a creature within **10 feet** that the Vistana can see.
- This magical ability, which the Vistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the animal friendship, charm person, or hold person spell (Vistana's choice), but requires neither so­matic nor material components
- The **spell save DC is 8 + the caster's proficiency bonus+ the caster's Charisma modifier.** If the target succeeds on the save, the Vistana is blinded until the end of the Vistana's next turn. A Vistana who uses Evil Eye can't use it again before finishing a short or long rest. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against a Vistana's Evil Eye, it is immune to the Evil Eye of all Vistani for 24 hours
