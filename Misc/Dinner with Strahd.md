## Arrival
- [[Cyrus Belview]] is dressed for the occasion
	- his clothes are washed, his hair is sort of tamed with a very pungent grease
	- he bows low and motions the party inside
	- he leads them to K8 where [[Rahadin]] is waiting

- If the players are not dressed for a fancy dinner, [[Rahadin]] chastises them and leads them upstairs to the guest quarters (K50) to change
	- [[Escher]] and [[Gertruda]] are there laying out suitable outfits for the players
	- they're somehow appropriately sized and exactly their tastes; how did [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] get those measurements?
		- ask them what are each of your characters going to be wearing?
	- [[Escher]] and [[Gertruda]] offer to comb out the PCs' matted hair
		- they carefully clean the comb in between brushes (for scrying)

## Dinner
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is not an illusion, but is playing the organ when they enter (as described in the book)
-  When the song concludes, he turns and greets them warmly, by name
	- Strahd welcomes the PCs to Ravenloft
	- inquires after their health
	- their enjoyment of their journey to Ravenloft
	- and their time in the valley of Barovia
	- He asks how they have enjoyed their time in his land, and asks their opinion on Castle Ravenloft

- Then invites all to be seated

- There are others at the dinner either as guests or as wait staff:
	- [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] is actually an accomplished cook and head chef
		- he cooks every meal
	- There is a maid acting as a waitress [[Helga]]
		- doesn't make eye contact or say a word
	- Strahd's consorts also come to dinner
		- [[Escher]]
		- [[Ludmilla Villisevic]]
		- [[Anastrasya Karelova]]
		- [[Volenta Popofsky]]
		- maybe [[Gertruda]]
- Make dinner a nice fancy multi-course dinner; maybe even cook for the players
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] sends the [[Vistani]] in search of rare foods
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and the vampire spawns do not eat
	- they just sit there drinking goblets of what is probably blood

### Flow of Dinner
#### Starter
- a bowl of lobster bisque is set in front of each player
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] makes a formal introduction, introduces the consorts, talks about how he came to live in this land, and asks each player about their backstory in turn

>Welcome, my friends. I fear that we have yet to have formal introductions. I am Count Strahd von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia, Master of Castle Ravenloft. Tonight, you are my guests, and no harm shall befall you while you remain in my home. I am a man of my word, and you have it.
>These are my three brides, Ludmilla Villisevic, Anastrasya Karelova, Volenta Popofsky, and I believe you have already met my consort Escher.
>
>As you eat, let me share with you a brief history of these lands and of this Castle.
>
>After the death of my father, King Barov, I waged a long war, finally killing the last of my family's enemies, liberating the people in this very valley. I decided to settle here, and thus named the land Barovia after my late father.
>
>I scoured my newly conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of my ancestral homeland.
>
>Once Castle Ravenloft was completed, I invited its namesake, my mother, Queen Ravenovia, to join me here. Alas, mother did not survive the journey, but her spirit lives on in this castle.
>
>Now, please tell me more about each of yourselves. Your homelands, your story, your lives.

- Ask each player to explain their backstories

#### Main Course
- the bowl of lobster bisque is cleared away and replaced by a plate of sliced tender beef framed by vibrant greens
	- for [[Shalooti]] and [[Bardolf]] salmon on a cedar plank
- In between each character is placed a bowl of freshly baked bread and a pad of freshly churned butter


- Strahd discusses the party's accomplishments:

>"You must wonder why I invited you here tonight. Your exploits are becoming the talk of the valley, and I find myself both amused and intrigued by your progress.
>
>You destroyed the Durst manor, lifting its ancient curse. A commendable act, even if that house of horrors had a certain charm. Then, you burned down the old windmill. It was rather an eyesore, so for that, I am surprisingly grateful.
>
>In Vallaki, you cleansed the orphanage of its malevolent spirits, bringing peace to those tormented souls. You unleashed a tiger upon the town—yes, Bardolf, I know it was you. You even brought me those cursed bones that had vexed me for centuries. And, of course," he turns his gaze to Pelanil, "you killed my future bride. A bold and reckless move.
>
>You’ve played the saviors for the Martikovs—rescuing them from blights, defeating the monstrous tree, and reviving their vineyard with a gem stolen from Baba Lysaga. Your heroics are almost tedious in their predictability.
>
>But what astonishes me most is that you have rekindled the beacon at Argynvostholt. That ancient light, shining defiantly in the darkness, was a feat I did not expect.
>
>So, tell me, what is your end goal? Why do you pursue these actions? Is it glory you seek? Redemption? Or do you harbor the foolish hope of my defeat? What drives you to such lengths in this land of shadows and despair?"

- Strahd discusses his goals (TODO:)

- At this point, there can be a bunch of side conversations
>Please, eat, be merry. Conversate with one another

#### Dessert
- Saucers of fresh fruit are brought forth
	- the vibrant colors of the fruit, picked at the height of their season contrast with the dark shadows of the castle

>Surely now, you must have some questions for me. Please, I'm all ears

[[Strahd's Answers to Questions]]

- If tensions are high, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] tries to smooth things over with a joke:
>Castle Ravenloft has an extensive library. Just the other day, I was reading a book about an immortal dog. It was impossible to put down

- Strahd has prepared a [[Wall of Force]] spell to deal with attacks from players and block himself and his consorts
- He tries to get things back on track
	- worst case, he and the consorts disappear for the hall in mist form
		- all lights go out
		- Strahd's guarantee of protection goes away

>I assure you this wall is for your protection. You're trying to skip to the end of the story, but there are so many pages to go.

- Sow distrust

>One of you will betray the others. Which one will it be?


## After Dinner
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] invites them to stay the night
	- says they should feel free to explore the castle, but only the upper levels
- They're escorted back to their rooms by [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]]
- They have protection unless they get into shit
	- Going downstairs makes [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] mad
		- especially into [[Sergei]]'s crypt
	- None of the traps upstairs are set
		- but if they try to unlock locked doors, there may be trouble

## Morning
- In the morning, [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] escorts them back to the carriage and says that it will take them to anywhere in Barovia
	- once they arrive there, the doors slam shut, and it bolts back towards [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]]
	- Consider throwing a bunch of vampire spawn and dire wolves at them once they arrive
		- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] still wants them dead
