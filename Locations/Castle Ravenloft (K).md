## Random Encounters

The first time the characters enter a castle area that isn't otherwise occupied, check for a random encounter. Also check for a random encounter every 10 minutes the characters spend resting in the castle.

In most circumstances, a random encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher on a d20. To determine what the characters encounter, consult the table below.

I, Count Strahd von Zarovich, son of King Barov von Zarovich, sentence you to death." Strahd gently places his wine glass on the end table beside his chair.
