## Laws
- No one shall speak Strahd's name out loud or carry written documents with his name on them
- No one shall speak poorly of the Baron or the festivals nor hold any documents that present either in an ill light
- Everyone shall take part in preparing the festivals
	- The Vallakians treat this sort of like Jury Duty
- Everyone shall attend the festivals
	- Every festival, guards go door to door and patrol the streets to make sure no one is missing out
	- Of course, they can't actually check everywhere, so hiding isn't impossible
	- But getting caught avoiding a festival is grounds for a steep punishment
- Regular laws apply
	- e.g. murdering a civilian would result in incarceration, but murdering a guard would mean execution
 
### Punishments
- Time in stocks between a day to a few weeks
- Seizure of assets
- Imprisonment at Vallaki's Reformation House
- Personal reformation conducted by [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]
	- He chooses a random dissenter and takes them to his mansion for hands-on torture
- public hanging
	- doesn't happen often, and reserved for severe dissenters that repeat offense

## Locations
### The Gates
>The Old Svalich Road meanders into a valley watched over by dark, brooding mountains to the north and south. The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber.
>
>The dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them. Planted in the ground and flanking the road outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves' heads impaled on them.

When approaching:
>One of the figures just inside the gate, yells out "Who goes there?"

Guard names: [[Valentin Ulrich]] and [[Alana Ivanova]]

- A 15-foot-high wall encloses the town, its vertical logs held together with thick ropes and mortar. The top of each log has been sharpened to a point. Wooden scaffolding hugs the inside of the palisade twelve feet off the ground, enabling guards to peer over the wall there

- Three tall gates made of iron bars lead into town:
	- The north gate is sometimes called the Zarovich Gate, or "the gate to the lake," because it leads to Lake Zarovich (chapter 2, area L).
	- The west gate is referred to as the Sunset Gate, even though no living person in Vallaki has seen an undimmed sunset. A few abandoned cottages line the road outside this gate.
	- The east gate is also known as the Morning Gate, or, as some locals like to call it, the Mourning Gate.
- Heavy iron chains with iron padlocks keep the gates shut at night
	- During the day, the gates are closed but not typically locked
- Two town [[#Statblocks|wall guards]] stand just inside each gate
	- The guards greet all visitors with suspicion, particularly those who arrive at night
	- If the characters arrive at night, one or more of them must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the guards to unlock the gate and let them enter
- If trouble breaks out at one of the gates, the guards there cry out, "To arms!"
	- Their shouts are echoed across Vallaki, putting the entire town on alert within minutes
	- Vallaki has twenty-four human [[guard|guards]], half of whom are on duty at any given time
		- (six stand watch at the gates, six patrol the walls)
		- The town can also muster a militia of fifty able-bodied human [[#Statblocks|Vallaki Commoners]]

#### Interrogation
- The point is to make it clear that [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] takes itself seriously

**Before opening the gates**:
- Who are you (Who goes there)
- What's your business in town?
	- Just looking for anything suspicious
	- If the PCs seem doubtful, have the guards latch onto that doubt and drill them
- (optional) What is your relation to [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]?
	- They want to filter out [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] supporters
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s family name is well know, and she can help with any mistakes here
	- She'll happily present herself to the guards
 
**The Laws of Vallaki**:
- Open the gates
- Have the guards give them a rundown of Vallaki law:

>Once inside, the mention of the name "Strahd" is strictly illegal, even in written form. Know that even now as I say the name, it is the last time you will hear it within the gates. Instead, if you must refer to the aforementioned individual, you will refer to him simply as, "The Devil."
>
>This noble town holds a festival each week in honor of the resident's general merriment and continued support of the Burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich. As guests of Vallaki, you will not be required to aid in the preparation for our festivals. However, your attendance and participation in each and every festival is absolutely mandatory for the length of your stay. Failure to attend will be in strict opposition to Vallakian law. The next great Vallakian festival, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, will be held in three days time in the town square.
>
>Failure to comply with any Vallakian law will mark you as criminals to our city and you will be punished as such in accordance to our justice system. If you have any questions, now is the time to ask them.

- Reinforce these laws as much as necessary
- If asked about:
	- **the festivals**: the guards explain them in the most positive light
	- **punishment**: only the basics; anywhere between a fine, imprisonment, or in severe cases, execution

**Weapons Registry**
- Before letting them into town, the guards ask the party to present their weapons for registry
- For each character, a scribe will write a quick sheet with their description, and name as well as a description of all their gear
- One of the guards thinks [[Elora]] looks strangely familiar (she's [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s long lost sister)
- **Fake Name**: DC12 deception
- **Hide Weapon**: slight of hand against guard's passive perception
- If caught, guard will just get annoyed and ask for the truth

**Inside**
- After all this, they let the party in
>This town is absolutely bustling. The streets are teeming with people, far more than you remember seeing in the empty streets of [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]. And some of them even seem to be... smiling. This place almost strikes you as normal. At least compared to the places you've seen thus far in this godforsaken realm.

- The players will probably head west through town from the eastern gate
	- unless they fixate on a specific building, go ahead and skip [[#Arasek Stockyard (N5)]] and [[#Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)]]
	- They'll probably be heading to the [[#Blue Water Inn (N2)]] from a townie's advice, or to [[#St Andral's Church (N1)]] on [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s request
	- They land in [[#Town Square (N8)]]

### House Occupants
- If the characters explore a residence other than the burgomaster's mansion, roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the house's occupant:

|d20|Occupant|
|---|---|
|1-3|None|
|4-5|2d4 [[Swarm of Rats]]|
|6-18|Vallakian townsfolk|
|19-20|Vallakian [[Cultist]]|

- **Rats**: A house infested with rats appears abandoned at first. The rats are servants of Strahd and attack if the characters explore the interior of the house
- **Townsfolk**: A house of Vallakian townsfolk contains 1d4 adults (LG male and female human [[Commoner]]s and 1d8-1 children (LG male and female human noncombatants)
	- Anyone who listens at the door hears chatter from within
	- Townsfolk won't willingly invite strangers into their homes, but they will speak with characters from behind closed doors or while standing in their vestibules
- **Cultists**: A cult haven contains 2d4 Vallakian adults (LE male and female [[Cultist]]s  and one [[Cult Fanatic]] (LE male or female) who leads them in prayer or orchestrates ritual sacrifices
	- These cultists worship devils and consider [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona Wachter]] to be their spiritual leader.

### St Andral's Church (N1)
>This slouching, centuries-old stone church has a bulging steeple in the back and walls lined with cracked, stained glass windows depicting pious saints. A fence of wrought iron encloses a garden of gravestones next to the church. A thin mist creeps among the graves.

#### Book
This church is dedicated to the [[The Morninglord|Morninglord]] and named after [[St. Andral]], whose bones once rested under the altar (see the "Bones of St. Andral" section).

[[Father Lucian Petrovich]] oversees the church and does his best to raise spirits. Assisting him is an orphan and altar boy named [[Yeska]]. A brawny lad with a perpetually furrowed brow named [[Milivoj]] (see below) tends the grounds and digs graves.

At night, the church is packed with 2d6+6 frightened Vallakian adults (LG male and female human commoners) and 2d6 equally terrified Vallakian children (LG male and female human noncombatants). [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] offers his nightly congregation his prayers and the promise of [[St. Andral]]'s protection. Among [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s nightly flock is a sad old woman named [[Willemina Rikalova]]. Her son, the shoemaker [[Udo Lukovich]], has been imprisoned for speaking out against the burgomaster (see area N3m). She prays that her son will be set free.

##### Bones of St. Andral
Until recently, the church was protected from [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s depredations by the bones of [[St. Andral]], which were sealed in a crypt beneath the church's main altar. But now the church is at risk because someone broke into the crypt a few nights ago and stole the bones. Until recently, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] was the only person in Vallaki who knew about the bones, but he recalls mentioning them to [[Yeska]] over a month ago to put the fearful boy at ease. After the bones were stolen, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asked [[Yeska]] if he told anyone else about the bones. The boy nodded but wouldn't divulge a name.

The culprit is [[Milivoj]], whom [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] correctly suspects. But the priest has been reluctant to confront [[Milivoj]] because the lad is so temperamental. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] has not reported the theft for fear of the distress that the news might cause, and he doesn't want to ruin the burgomaster's festival. If the party includes a good-aligned cleric or paladin, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] mentions the theft in the hope that the characters can provide assistance. [[St. Andral]]'s crypt is a 10-foot-square, 5-foot high chamber beneath the chapel. The crypt can be opened with a small switch on the underside of the altar's lip. The flipped, the altar will slide out of the way, revealing a short staircase down into a tiny crypt

If one of the characters confronts [[Milivoj]] (run the orphanage first) and succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, he admits that [[Yeska]] told him about the bones. He also admits to passing along the information to [[Henrik van der Voort]], the local coffin maker (area N6), and to stealing the bones for [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] in return for money to help feed his younger sisters and brothers.

The theft of the bones has left the church vulnerable to attack by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s minions (see "St. Andral's Feast" in the "Special Events" section at the end of this chapter). If the bones are returned to their resting place, St. Andral's church once again becomes hallowed ground, as though the building was protected by a hallow spell.

#### Interactions
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] will ask [[Pelanil]] (cleric) to look into the bones
	- The bones are what offers the church protection
		- [[St Andral]]'s welcomed people into his home to protect them from [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] (Vampire Allowance) for so long the spot and his bones (after death) became consecrated
		- But with them gone, the church is vulnerable
	- Until recently, he was the only one who knew of their existence, but he remembers telling [[Yeska]] to put him at ease
		- [[Yeska]] admitted he told someone, but wouldn't say who
		- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] suspects [[Milivoj]]
	- He'll show them where they used to be (clear the room first and have [[Yeska]] watch the doors)
- If pressed, [[Yeska]] tells them he told [[Milivoj]] about the bones

### Blue Water Inn (N2)
>Gray smoke issues from the chimney of this large, two-story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof, upon which several ravens have perched. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall.

	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] is hurt if the characters complain about the wines, for his family makes them
- The inn's wine supply is almost depleted, and the latest delivery from the Wizard of Wines winery is overdue
	- If the characters claim to be adventurers, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] asks them if they would be so kind as to find out what's holding up the latest shipment
- At any given time, another 1d4 [[wereraven]]s (members of [[The Keepers of the Feather]]) are present at the inn, either perched on the rooftop in raven form or huddled inside in human form
	- These wereravens are loyal friends of the Martikovs and help protect the inn
- If things happen to go south, the Martikovs will give the players sanctuary in the attic/hayloft

#### Interactions
- On first entering, read [[#Taproom (N2c)]] description
- Try to keep the wereravens a secret for as long as possible

##### Rumors
- [ ] One of the Inn's best patrons and the town drunk, Bluto, hasn't been seen for a couple days. He's often found uselessly fishing on Lake Zarovich, north of town.
- [ ] There's a shortage of wine. Danika and Urwin have family at the Winery, but due to a past falling out, they haven't spoken in years. Urwin is worried about the Winery but has yet to set aside his pride to send a word as of yet. The last shipment was due a week ago.

##### [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] is at the bar
- She is excited over the arrival of new people
- Let the party converse and recount their deeds of heroism
	- Maybe get [[Anakir]] to talk about what they've been through
	- "You there look like you've had your fair share of adventures. Tell me what you've done"
- Has tons of [[Vallaki Lore|info on Vallaki]]
- She doesn't talk openly of the political tensions in town
	- but phrases her words to imply the true oppression going on in town

##### The Wachter Brothers
- They're just as jovial as the [[Vistani]] at [[Tser Pool Encampment (G)|Tser Pool]]
- They love to drink and party and cause mischief
	- players shouldn't suspect anything bad about them
- They don't know about their mother's cult
- They have strong opinions about [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]]'s family
	- because of their sister, [[Stella Wachter|Stella]]'s condition

##### Staying the Night
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] has [[Brom Martikova|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] lead the party to their room
	- Role play them to be really sweet and show the kind nature of the family
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] will charge for the stay, but if they see [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] first, he'll offer them a room for free

##### Rictavio
- If staying at the inn, he will approach them in the late evening to warn them of one thing or another
	- Make it be whatever the players have been talking the most about that could get them in trouble:
		- the stocks -> he explains Vallaki Law, [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] -> she's a dangerous woman
- He invites them back to [[#Private Guest Room (N2n)|his room]] in the inn for a private conversation
- He reveals his role as a carnival man is only a front for his spying ([[The Keepers of the Feather|Keepers of the Feather]], and the [[Vistani]])
- He tells them Vallaki isn't safe and that they should leave town quickly
- He asks why they're in Vallaki anyway
	- If they mention [[Madam Eva]], he's intrigued and willing to interpret the [[Card Reading]]
		- and will offer the party his book if they ask for it
- He knows basically everything going on in town (spy), and he'll tell the party most of it (but not all)

#### Well (N2a)
>A 3-foot-high stone rim surrounds the mouth of this 40-foot-deep, moss-lined well. The inn draws fresh water from this well.

#### Outside Staircase (N2b)
A wooden staircase hugs the outer wall of the inn and leads up to guest quarters on the upper floor (areas N2l and N2m). The sturdy wooden door at the top of the stairs can be barred from the inside.

#### Taproom (N2c)
>Damp cloaks hang from pegs in the entrance portico. The tavern is packed with tables and chairs, with narrow paths meandering between them. A bar stretches along one wall, under a balcony that can be reached by a wooden staircase that hugs the north wall. Another balcony overhangs an entrance to the east. All the windows are fitted with thick shutters and crossbars. Lanterns hanging above the bar and resting on the tables bathe the room in dull orange light and cast shadows upon the walls, most of which are adorned with wolf heads mounted on wooden plaques.
>
>	The place is lively and homey, filled with the smells of homemade meals and cheery laughter

- [[Danika Dorakova]] usually tends bar while [[Urwin Martikov]] busies himself in the kitchen
	- [[Brom Martikova|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] scamper about
- Between dawn and noon, there are no patrons here, and the Martikovs are upstairs in their bedrooms (areas N2o and N2p) or in the attic (area N2q).
	- From noon to dusk, the taproom holds 2d4 local patrons
	- Between dusk and midnight, 2d8 Vallakians are here
	- In addition, one or more of the following people might be present during this time:
		- **Wolf Hunters**:  [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] are local hunters who frequent the Blue Water Inn. They kill wolves and sell the meat for a living, and their work is dangerous and bloody
			- Both men are grim and have haunted looks in their eyes
		- **Wachter Brothers**: [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter]] are brothers of noble birth
			- They are brash drunkards always looking for trouble, though they are smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers
		- **Rictavio**: The lone guest of the Blue Water Inn at present is a colorfully dressed half-elf bard who goes by the name [[Rictavio]]
			- He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable, yet he asserts they are true indeed
			- He claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land
			- He's been staying at the inn for almost a month, taking advantage of [[Urwin Martikov]]'s generosity and good nature
			- When he arrived, he was accompanied by a monkey named Piccolo
				- The monkey wasn't welcome at the inn, so [[Rictavio]] gave it to the local toymaker (see [[#Blinsky Toys (N7)]]).

#### Wine Storage (N2d)
>This hallway contains three curtained alcoves as well as a larger area stuffed with wine barrels.

- The Martikovs store their wine here
- Tucked behind red curtains are three alcoves, each one containing a half-emptied wine barrel lying on its side in a wooden brace
	- Twelve empty wine barrels are piled two high near the door to the kitchen (area N2e)
	- All the barrels have the [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|Wizard of Wines]] name burned into them
- Nine of the fifteen barrels, including two of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have the following label burned into their sides, under the winery's name: Purple Grapemash No. 3.
- Six of the fifteen barrels, including one of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have a different label: Red Dragon Crush.
- The double doors that lead outside can be barred shut from within.

#### Kitchen (N2e)
>This room looks like the kitchen of someone who loves to cook. It has piles of pots, walls lined with utensils and shelves of ingredients, and all manner of pleasant odors. Two lanterns hang above a sturdy pine worktable in the middle of the clutter. A pot of soup bubbles on the hearth.

- [[Urwin Martikov]] is found here during the day
- A cupboard against the east wall holds most of the inn's supply of cutlery and dishware, none of it valuable
- A door in the west wall leads outside and is usually barred from the inside
- {A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pushed open to reveal a wooden staircase that leads up to [[#Secret Stairs and Hall (N2i)]]}

#### Stable (N2f)
- The sliding wooden doors on the west wall of this room are held shut by an iron lock and chain
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] carries the key to the lock
	- The doors to the north and south can be barred shut from the inside but are usually unlocked
 
>You hear the squawking of birds and the plaintive whinny of a horse as you peer inside this stable. The stalls are clean and well maintained. One of them contains a gray mare. A small door is set into the east wall, and a wooden ladder gives access to a loft overhead. Perched on the wooden railing that encloses the loft are dozens of ravens.

- Any character who has a horse can keep it here for 1 sp per night. The gray mare is a [[draft horse]] named Drusilla, and she likes apples
	- The horse belongs to [[Rictavio]]
- The small door in the east wall can be pulled open to reveal [[#Storage (N2g)]]
	- The loft is described in [[#Raven's Loft (N2h)]]

#### Storage (N2g)
- This small room lies under a wooden staircase ([[#Secret Stairs and Hall (N2i)]])
- Hanging from wooden pegs are saddles and barding to equip two horses
- In an unlocked wooden chest are a dozen horseshoes, a wooden mallet, and a mound of horseshoe nails

#### Raven's Loft (N2h)
>Dim light spilling in through a pair of dirt-encrusted windows reveals piles of hay with pitchforks sticking out of them. Ravens rule this roost—you can see hundreds of them.

- Characters who search the loft thoroughly find three pitchforks and a locked wooden chest buried under a pile of hay (see "Treasure" below), next to a secret door
- If the characters tamper with the chest, the ravens gather into four [[Swarm of Ravens]] and attack
	- If two swarms are killed, the others flee
	- Otherwise, they cease their attacks if the characters leave the chest alone
	- If the fighting continues for more than 3 rounds, [[Urwin Martikov]] and two other [[Wereraven]]s hear the ruckus and investigate (in human form)

- A secret door in the back of the loft can be pushed open to reveal a bedchamber ([[#Master Bedroom (N2p)]]) beyond
	- No ability check is required to spot the secret door, because light in the room beyond slips through the door's cracks

**Treasure**
- Inside the locked chest are 140 ep, 70 pp, two [[Elixir of health]] [elixirs of health](http://longo.com.br/5e/items.html#elixir%20of%20health_dmg), three [[reference/items/Potion of Healing|Potion of Healing]], and a gray [[Bag of Tricks]]
	- The coins are embossed with the profiled likeness of Strahd von Zarovich

#### Secret Stairs and Hall (N2i)
>A wooden staircase to the north descends fifteen feet to a landing. A window dimly illuminates a short, wood-paneled hallway that runs west to east.

- Guests aren't told about the inn's secret hallway
	- [[Rictavio]] knows of its existence because he has heard the Martikov boys opening and closing the secret door closest to his room ([[#Private Guest Room (N2n)]])

- At each end of this area is a secret door, each of which is easy to spot from inside the hallway (no ability check required)
	- The northern secret door, at the bottom of the staircase, can be pulled open to reveal the kitchen ([[#Kitchen (N2e)]]) beyond
	- The eastern secret door can be pulled open to reveal a balcony ([[#Great Balcony (N2j)]]) that overlooks the taproom

#### Great Balcony (N2j)
>A wooden balcony stretches the full length of the taproom, enclosed by a wooden railing carved with raven motifs. The taproom's many lanterns illuminate the rafters and cast ominous shadows on the peaked ceiling.

- The balcony floor is 15 feet above the taproom floor
- A secret door at the south end of the western wall can be pushed open to reveal a wood-paneled hallway ([[#Secret Stairs and Hall (N2i)]]) beyond

#### Guest Balcony (N2k)
>This twenty-foot-long balcony provides a clear view of the bar and has a wooden railing carved with raven motifs. The taproom's many lanterns illuminate the rafters and cast ominous shadows on the peaked ceiling.

- **Navigation Shortcuts**:  The balcony floor is 15 feet above the taproom floor.

#### Guest Rooms (N2l)
- These two rooms have identical furnishings

>Two cozy beds with matching footlockers rest in the far corners of this fifteen-foot-square room. Wolf furs are heaped atop each bed. Between the beds, a lamp sits on a table under a shuttered window. Two tall black wardrobes stand against the wall by the door.

- The door to this room can be locked from the inside, and each guest gets a key
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] carry spare keys
	- The footlockers and wardrobes are empty and are for the use of guests

#### Guest Room (N2m)
>Four plain beds with straw mattresses line the north wall of this well-lit room. Each bed comes with a matching footlocker to store clothing and other belongings. A table and four chairs occupy the corner across from the door. An oil lamp resting on the table casts a bright yellow flame.

- The door to this room can be locked from the inside, and each guest receives a key
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] carry spare keys
	- The footlockers are empty and are for the use of guests

#### Private Guest Room (N2n)
- [[Rictavio]] has a key to this room, which is locked at all times
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] carry spare keys
	- The door's lock can be picked, but discretion is called for because the door is in plain view of the taproom below

>This small guest room contains a bed heaped with wolf furs, a footlocker, a tall wardrobe, and a writing desk with matching chair. An oil lamp rests atop the desk near a journal bound in a red leather jacket.

- [[Rictavio]] sleeps here between midnight and dawn
	- At dawn, he leaves to check on his horse ([[#Stable (N2f)]]) and his wagon ([[#Arasek Stockyard (N5)]]), returning to the inn around noon
	- Between noon and dusk, there's a 40 percent chance he is here; otherwise, he's in the taproom ([[#Taproom (N2c)]])
	- At dusk, he leaves the inn to tend to his horse and his wagon again, then returns to his room to retire for the night
- [[Rictavio]] is too clever to leave anything valuable or incriminating in his room
	- The footlocker and the wardrobe contain nothing but common clothes and travel wear

**[[Rictavio]]'s Journal**
	The journal on the desk is a bit of artifice that [[Rictavio]] created to perpetuate the illusion that he is an entertainer in search of new acts for his traveling carnival. His writing makes frequent mention of conversations with Drusilla (which the journal fails to mention is the name of his horse) and recounts many long and tedious journeys by wagon. He has also written about various "oddities" he has seen in his travels, including the following:
- A "werehare" child (a boy who transforms into a rabbit on nights of the full moon)
- A half-orc woman named Gorabacha who could chew through iron chains
- A giant, man-eating plant that had the most remarkable singing voice
- A pair of conjoined goblins
- A small man with no legs named Filmore Stunk, who could drink whole casks of wine without getting drunk

#### Boys' Bedroom (N2o)
>A large, painted toy box rests between two small, cozy beds. Murals of ravens in flight are painted on the walls above the wood paneling.

- [[Brom Martikova|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov]] don't spend much time in this room
- The toy box contains a pile of neglected toys, many of them etched with the slogan "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!" The toys include the following:
	- A miniature puppet theater with appropriately sized marionettes of a king, a queen, a prince, a princess, an executioner, a tax collector, a dunce, a vampire, and a vampire hunter
	- A garish toy Vistani wagon hitched to a wooden horse and filled with tiny wooden Vistani figures
	- A pair of painted wooden clown masks, one displaying a mean scowl and the other a frightened expression
	- A wooden top painted with images of scarecrows chasing children through the forest
	- A stuffed (real) bat on puppet strings

- A hidden trapdoor in the 8-foot-high ceiling opens into a secret attic ([[#Secret Attic (N2q)]]).

#### Master Bedroom (N2p)
>Matching end tables flank a large wood-framed bed with a red silk canopy. Across from the bed hangs a tapestry depicting a beautiful mountain valley. The other walls are dominated by a fireplace and a wardrobe.

- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] retire to this room every night before heading to the attic ([[#Secret Attic (N2q)]]) to sleep
	- This room is for appearances only and contains no valuables
- A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pulled open to reveal the loft beyond ([[#Raven's Loft (N2h)]]).
- A hidden trapdoor in the 8-foot-high ceiling opens into a secret attic ([[#Secret Attic (N2q)]]).

#### Secret Attic (N2q)
>This ten-foot-wide, thirty-five-foot-long attic has a ceiling that slants down toward the west, dropping from a height of eight feet to a height of five feet. Four straw nests cover the floor, and a locked iron strongbox sits against the north wall. A small square opening in the south wall leads outside. Two trapdoors with iron hinges are set into the floor.

- The Martikovs sleep here at night in hybrid form
	- The opening in the south wall is just big enough for a raven or other Tiny creature to pass through
	- The wereravens can use this opening as an escape route
- The strongbox is described in "Treasure" below
- Two trapdoors, clearly visible on the floor, can be pulled open to reveal the bedchambers (areas N2o and N2p) that lie directly beneath them.

**Treasure**
[[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] carries the key to the locked iron strongbox. The lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The box contains a sack of 150 ep (each coin bearing the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich), six pieces of jewelry (worth 250 gp each), and three [[reference/items/Potion of Healing|Potion of Healing]].


### Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)
>This mansion has walls of plastered stone that display many scars where the plaster has fallen away from age and neglect. Drapes cover every window, including a large, arched opening above the mansion's double entrance doors.

- People come and go from the mansion at all hours during the day. Guards bring criminals cited for "malicious unhappiness." Men and women arrive carrying bundles of twigs, which are piled about the mansion's grand foyer (area N3a) until the construction of the wicker sun for the Festival of the Blazing Sun gets under way.
- If the characters knock on the front doors, a maid ([[Kresimira]]) (LG female human commoner) lets them in, escorts them to the den (area N3e), and leaves to fetch the baron.

#### N3a. Entrance Hall and Vestibule
>Framed portraits adorn the walls of this grand foyer, which features a wide staircase with a sculpted railing. A long, carpeted hall attached to the foyer stretches almost the length of the mansion and has several doors leading away from it, including one at the far end. Bundles of twigs are heaped against the walls.

- The twigs are being stored here until they can be fashioned into a wooden effigy of the sun (for the Festival of the Blazing Sun).
- The stairs climb to the upstairs gallery (area N3i).
- The portraits depict the baron, his family, and their ancestors. Close inspection reveals that some of the people portrayed look very much alike.
- Tucked in the northeast corner of the foyer is a vestibule packed with fine cloaks, coats, and boots.

#### N3b. Parlor
- This parlor contains a fine array of furnishings and draperies, with an overall feminine touch.
- The baroness sometimes entertains guests here.

#### N3c. Dining Room
- Characters can hear the chatter of female voices as they approach this room. The first time they peer inside, read:

>A chandelier of wrought iron fitted with wax candles hangs above a polished wooden dining table. Around the table are seated eight women of various ages in comfortable, high-backed chairs. They wear faded clothes, drink tea, and devour cake while a ninth woman, well dressed and very pleased with herself, circles the table and talks excitedly about decorations for the impending festival.

- The women seated at the table are eight Vallakian peasants (LG female commoners) invited to spend time with the baroness, Lydia Petrovna, who is bribing them with tea and cake. Lydia has assigned these women the task of stitching children's costumes and weaving together a wicker sun for the Festival of the Blazing Sun.
- Lydia assumes that the characters are here at the invitation of her husband, the burgomaster. She calls for the maid to take them to the den (area N3e) and then to inform Baron Vallakovich (see area N2l) that his guests have arrived.
- A serving table stands in one corner of the dining hall.

#### N3d. Preparation Room
>White sheets cover two plain wooden tables in the center of this room. Neatly arranged atop one table is a complete set of polished silverware. The other table is covered with wicker baskets containing turnips and beets.

- The beets and turnips are for the Festival of the Blazing Sun
- **Treasure.** The silverware set is worth 150 gp.

#### N3e. Den
- Characters who ask to see the burgomaster are brought here.
>Padded chairs and couches line the walls of this cozy, carpeted den. The room reeks of pipe smoke, and mounted on the east wall is the head of an angry-looking brown bear.

- The mounted bear's head is meant to unnerve visitors.
	- It serves as a subtle warning not to antagonize the burgomaster, who spends most of his time in the library (area N3l).
	- Although the burgomaster claims that his father killed the bear, the head was actually a gift given to his family by the late Szoldar Grygorovich, father of the wolf hunter Szoldar Szoldarovich (area N2).

#### N3f. Servants' Quarters
>This room contains four simple beds and an equal number of plain wooden trunks.

- The household staff consists of a maid (LG female human commoner) and a cook (LG male human commoner): [[Velimir]] (cook), [[Kresimira]] (maid)
- The other two beds belonged to the butler ([[Bratomil]]) and the baroness's lady-in-waiting ([[Faina Janek]], both of whom have gone missing (see area N3t).
- The trunks contain the staff's clothing and uniforms.

#### N3g. Kitchen
>A cook wearing a white apron over a black smock busies himself in this warm, well-appointed kitchen. A staircase in one corner climbs to the upper floor.

- [[Velimir]]
- The staircase leads to the upstairs gallery (area N3i).
- A door in the west wall leads to a garden outside.
	- The door is usually locked, and both the cook and the burgomaster carry keys to unlock it.

#### N3h. Pantry
>This pantry contains shelves of foodstuffs, although half of the shelves are bare. Two barrels of wine stand against the east wall.

- The pantry has not been fully stocked for as long as anyone can remember
- The two barrels contain a fine wine called Red Dragon Crush, created by the Wizard of Wines winery—facts burned into the side of each barrel.

#### N3i. Upstairs Gallery
If the characters arrive here from the entrance hall (area N3a), read:

>The staircase climbs twenty feet to a beautifully appointed gallery that continues toward the west, running almost the length of the mansion. Framed landscape paintings line the walls, and red silk drapes cover a ten-foot-tall arched window of leaded glass.

If the characters arrive here from the kitchen (area N3g), read:

>The staircase climbs to a ten-foot-wide gallery that stretches almost the length of the mansion. Breathtaking paintings of landscapes line the walls. Two separate, narrow hallways lead away from the gallery to the north.

#### N3j. Izek's Bedroom
- The door to this room is unlocked

- Have [[Elora]] enter first if possible
>You open the door to a rather Spartan bedroom. There's the bed, a chest of drawers, and some shelves. Or rather, it would be sparse if it weren't filled with hundreds of handmade dolls. And they all... look... just like... YOU."

>Some of the dolls fill a long bookshelf, and others are arranged in neat rows on wall-mounted shelves. Still others are piled atop a bed and a heavy wooden chest.

- [[Izek Strazni]], sleeps here at night. During the day, he is in town taking care of his master's business. 
- Izek's chest is unlocked and contains a heap of wrinkled clothes, under which is a nonmagical shortsword.
- A thorough search of the room reveals a few empty wine bottles under the bed. The label on each bears the winery's name, the Wizard of Wines, and wine's name, Purple Grapemash No. 3.

- **Izek's Doll Collection.** Each doll has a small tag stitched into its clothing that reads "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!"
	- Izek had the local toymaker, Gadof Blinsky (area N7), craft the dolls in [[Elora]]'s likeness.

#### N3k. Victor's Bedroom
>This handsomely appointed room contains a canopied bed, a low bookshelf, and a full-length mirror in a wooden frame on the wall across from the door. Set into the north wall is an arched window of leaded glass. Nothing here seems unusual.

- Nothing about his bedroom betrays Victor's deviant nature or magical proclivities.
- The books include collections of Barovian fables and tomes about mythology, heraldry, and other innocuous subjects.

#### N3l. Library
>Floor-to-ceiling shelves line every wall of this windowless room, and the number of books contained here is nothing short of astounding.

>A brass oil lamp sits atop a large desk in the center of the room. The chair behind the desk is comfortably padded and has the symbol of a roaring bear stitched into its back cushion.

- If the burgomaster has not been drawn elsewhere, he is here. Add:

>Standing behind the chair, holding an open book, is a bear of a man. His breastplate, rapier, silk tunic, and greasy beard glisten in the lamplight. Resting on small rugs to his left and right are a pair of black mastiffs.

- A paranoid man, he wears his breastplate and rapier even while relaxing in his library.
- Two of his servants, the butler ([[Bratomil]] and his wife's [[Faina Janek|lady-in-waiting]], have vanished without a trace in the past week, so he has good cause to be worried.

- The baron's desk contains three drawers stuffed with blank sheets of parchment, jars of ink, and writing quills.
	- It also holds thick books of tax records dating back to the times of the baron's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.

- The baron wears a signet ring and carries three keys: one that unlocks the outside door in area N3g, and two keys for the door and the manacles in area N3m.

- **Treasure.** The Vallakovich book collection contains old, leather-bound tomes on virtually every subject. 
	- Use the [[Random Book Table]] (see chapter 4, area K37) to determine the subject matter of a particular book.

#### N3m. Locked Closet
- The door to this room is locked. The baron carries the key.
>This door is locked with deadbolt and a large iron padlock that attaches the door soundly to the wall from the outside.

>Chained to the back wall of this otherwise empty closet is a badly beaten man wearing nothing but a loincloth. The iron shackles have cut into his wrists, causing blood to trickle down his hands.

- The man is a Vallakian shoemaker named [[Udo Lukovich]] (LN male human commoner). He was arrested during the Wolf's Head Jamboree for carrying a sign that suggested that Vallakians should feed the baron to the wolves.
- [[Baron Vallakovich]] has the key to Udo's manacles. The manacles break if they take 10 damage or more from a single weapon attack.
- If the characters release [[Udo Lukovich|Udo]], his first desire is to return to his home.
	- Later, he plans to tell [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] (see area N1) of his ill treatment in the burgomaster's estate.
	- If the baron discovers that Udo has escaped or been set free, he sends [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] to find the shoemaker and bring him back for further questioning
	- Under great duress, Udo provides the names or descriptions of those who liberated him, turning the burgomaster against the characters.

#### N3n. Master Bedroom Closet
>Cloaks, coats, gowns, and other fancy apparel hang from hooks in this closet. Arranged on low shelves are many fine shoes, slippers, and boots.

#### N3o. Master Bedroom
>Time has faded the grandeur of this master bedroom. The furnishings have lost some of their color and splendor. A short pull-rope hangs from a wooden trapdoor in the ceiling.

- The baron and the baroness sleep in one bed at night. Nothing of value is kept here.
- The trapdoor in the ceiling can be pulled down to reveal an attic room (area N3r)
	- An unfolding wooden ladder allows easy access.

#### N3p. Bridal Gown and Spirit Mirror
>This room smells of powder and fine perfume. A vanity with a mirror stands against one wall next to a faceless wooden mannequin wearing a white bridal gown. Mounted on another wall is a full-length mirror with a gilded frame. A door in one corner leads to a garderobe.

- [[Lydia Petrovna|The Baroness]] used to while away long hours in this room, fondling her perfume collection and searching for solace in her own reflection
- Since her [[Faina Janek|lady-in-waiting]] went missing several days ago, the baroness has spent almost no time here.

- **Bridal Gown.** The white gown stored here belongs to the baroness. It reminds the her of happier times.

#### N3q. Bathroom
>An iron tub with clawed feet stands against the back wall. Neatly folded towels rest atop a table near the door.

#### N3r. Attic Room
- Characters are most likely to enter this room via a trapdoor in the ceiling of the master bedroom (area N3o).

>This dusty, twenty-foot-square room has a high-pitched ceiling that reaches its peak twenty feet above. The wooden rafters are shrouded in cobwebs. Except for an old table with a lantern on it, the room is empty.

- A door in the south wall can be pulled open to area N3s.

#### N3s. Attic Storage
>This large attic is full of old, forgotten things draped in white sheets. Piled around them are barrels, crates, trunks, and old furnishings covered with cobwebs and dust. You see a clear footpath through the maze.

- Characters can follow a single set of human footprints in the dust that lead to area N3t.
- Searching through the junk in this attic uncovers a few old paintings and antiques, but nothing of value.

#### N3t. Victor's Workroom
- [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] spends most of his time here, leaving only when he needs food or spell components. When the characters first set eyes on the door to this room, read:

>Someone has carved a large skull into this door. Hanging from the doorknob is a wooden sign that reads "ALL IS NOT WELL!" You hear a young man's voice beyond.

- Anyone who inspects the carving and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices a small, nearly invisible glyph etched into the skull's forehead.
- This is a glyph of warding (5d8 lightning damage) that triggers if anyone other than Victor opens the door.

- The voice belongs to [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]]. He is reading aloud from his spellbook.
	- Anyone who listens at the door and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check can tell he's badly pronouncing some kind of teleportation spell.

- If the characters open the door, read:
>Someone has taken old, mismatched furniture and created a study is this dusty, lamplit chamber. Tables are strewn with pieces of parchment, on which strange diagrams are drawn, and a freestanding bookshelf holds a collection of bones. A dusty rug covers the floor in front of a pine box, on which lounges a skeletal cat. Several more skeletal cats skulk about. Most unnerving of all is the sight of three small children standing with their backs to you in the northeast corner of the room.

- If the characters trigger the glyph of warding or otherwise announce their arrival, [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] casts a greater invisibility spell on himself and hides in a corner
	- Otherwise, he's visible

- If the characters can see Victor, read:
>In the center of the room, perched on a stool, is a thin young man with a premature streak of gray in his dark hair. He cradles an open leather-bound book in his arms.

- For practice and for fun, Victor dug up some old cat bones behind the Wachter estate (see area N4) and animated them, creating six [[Cat]] skeletons (use the cat stat block, but give them darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition). The skeletons attack only when Victor commands them to.
- The "children" standing in the corner are painted wooden dolls dressed in clothing that Victor wore as a child. He pretends they are his disobedient pupils.
- The sheets of parchment are covered with elaborate diagrams of teleportation circles. Victor drew them in an effort to learn the teleportation circle spell, which he's still trying to master (see "Teleportation Circle" below).
- The trunk contains several bolts of silk cloth, needles and thread, and a half-finished wizard's robe. Victor started to make the robe for himself but found the work tedious and stopped.

- **Teleportation Circle.** Victor's spellbook contains incomplete text for a [[Teleportation Circle]] spell, along with the sigil sequences of three permanent teleportation circles, the locations of which aren't described. There's not enough text to prepare the spell properly, but that hasn't stopped Victor from trying to learn to cast it.
- Victor recently inscribed his own version of a teleportation circle on the floor
	- It's hidden under the rug so that his parents don't find it.
	- In the past couple of weeks, Victor has managed to imbue the circle with magic, but he failed to account for several factors. His circle doesn't fade after use, nor does it function like the teleportation circle spell.
	- If the circle is used in the casting of a teleportation circle spell, whether the actual spell or Victor's version of it, any creature standing on the circle when the spell is cast takes 3d10 force damage and isn't teleported anywhere.
		- If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature is disintegrated.
	- Any character who studies the circle and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that Victor's circle is horribly flawed and potentially deadly when used.
- Victor has tested his circle on two reluctant servants ([[Bratomil]] and [[Faina Janek|Faina]]) (compelled by his suggestion spell), in both cases linking his circle to one of the other circles whose sigils are in his spellbook.
	- Each servant was torn apart before Victor's eyes before vanishing in a flash of purple light. Victor doesn't know how to fix the circle but plans to make more modifications to it before testing it again.

- **Treasure.** Victor's spellbook contains all the spells Victor has prepared (see the mage stat block in the Monster Manual) as well as the following spells: acid splash, animate dead, blight, cloudkill, darkvision, glyph of warding, levitate, mending, remove curse, and thunderwave.

### Wachterhaus (N4)
>This house seems disgusted with itself. A slouching roof hangs heavy over furrowed gables, and moss-covered walls sag and bulge under the weight of the vegetation. As you study the house's sullen countenance, you hear the edifice actually groan. Only then do you realize the extent to which the house hates what it has become.

#### Book
The Wachter family, once an influential noble line in Barovia, owns and occupies a mansion in Vallaki. The house's reigning governess, [[Fiona Wachter]], is a loyal servant of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]. She seeks to supplant [[Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] as the town burgomaster.

##### Roleplaying
Use the following information to roleplay [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]], her family, and her associates.

**Lady of the House.** [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona Wachter]] makes no secret of her family's long-standing loyalty to the von Zarovich line. She believes that Strahd von Zarovich is no tyrant but, at worst, a negligent landlord. She would happily serve Strahd as burgomaster of Vallaki, but she knows that [[Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] won't give up his birthright without a fight.

Fiona conspired to wed her young daughter, [[Stella Wachter|Stella]], to the baron's son, [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]], as part of a plot to gain a foothold in the baron's mansion, but [[Stella Wachter|Stella]] found [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] to be demented, and he showed no interest in [[Stella Wachter|Stella]] whatsoever. In fact, he spoke such unkind words to Stella that she went mad, and Fiona had to lock her daughter away. Actually, he broke her mind by practicing magic.

[[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s latest scheme to gain control of Vallaki is far more diabolical. She has started a cult based on devil worship and has written a manifesto that she reads to her "book club," which is made up of the most fanatical group members. Inspired by her words, these zealots have created smaller cults of their own. Once her cult has enough members, Fiona plans to take the town by force.

Another secret of [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]]'s is that she sleeps with the corpse of her dead husband, [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]], who died of sickness nearly three years ago and whom [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] cherished. [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] casts [[gentle repose]] spells on the corpse to keep it from deteriorating.

If the characters come to Wachterhaus looking for help to overthrow the burgomaster, [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] is all ears and suggests they start by killing the baron's evil henchman, [[Izek Strazni]]. She's happy to take care of the rest. If they come looking for a way to defeat [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] turns them away, stating in no uncertain terms that she is not, nor ever will be, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s enemy.

**Fiona's Sons.**
Fiona sees a lot of her husband in her sons, Nikolai and Karl (N male human nobles), who have grown into young men with a fondness for wine and trouble. They aren't home during the day, because they don't like attending to their mother or listening to her tiresome prattle. The characters might encounter them at the [[#Blue Water Inn (N2)]] or wandering about town. The brothers are home most nights, passed out in their beds after hours of heavy drinking.

[[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] have none of their mother's ambition or mean temper. They are aware of her cult, but they don't know that she sleeps with their dead father. This would be unwelcome news and probably turn them against their mother. They want only to spend their mother's money and make the most of their miserable situation, trapped as they are within the walls of Vallaki under the control of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and his puppet, [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]].

**Fiona's Spy.**
[[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] employs a money-grubbing named [[Ernst Larnak]] to keep her informed about everything that happens in town. [[Ernst Larnak|Ernst]] knows [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s secrets, and he would blackmail her in a heartbeat if their relationship went sour.

#### N4a. Front Door and Vestibule
The front door is locked and reinforced with bronze bands. All of the servants carry a key, as do [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and [[Ernst Larnak]]. The door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

If the characters knock on the front door, a servant opens a small window cut into the door at eye height and asks their business. Suspicious-looking strangers aren't invited inside, in case they're vampires.

>The front door opens into a narrow vestibule. Three stained-glass doors in wooden frames lead from it.

Two closets flank the front door. The western closet contains [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s outdoor clothes; the eastern one contains coats and boots that belong to her children.

#### N4b. Staircase
>A wooden staircase leads up to a balcony. At the foot of the stairs is a landing with three stained-glass doors in wooden frames.

The staircase climbs 15 feet to the upstairs hall (area N2l).

#### N4c. Kitchen
The house cook (see area N4h) rushes about this spotless kitchen most of the day, preparing meals or cleaning up after himself. A washbasin stands in the northeast corner. A slender door in the west wall leads to a small pantry.

#### N4d. Storage Room
This room holds crates of old clothing, as well as three barrels of drinking water, two empty wine barrels, and one full wine barrel. The wine barrels are emblazoned with the winery name, the [[Wizard of Wines]], and the wine's name, Red Dragon Crush.

#### N4e. Back Vestibule
The back door is locked and similar to the front door (area N4a) in every respect. The vestibule has plain wooden doors leading to areas N4d, N4f, and N4h.

#### N4f. Servants' Closet
>Servants' coats and aprons hang from hooks in this room, and boots are neatly lined up against the wall.

Anyone who searches the closet and makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a secret door in the south wall. The door can be pulled open to reveal a stone staircase (area N4g) that leads to the cellar.

#### N4g. Secret Staircase

>Iron torch sconces cling to the wall of a stone staircase that cuts its way through the heart of the old house.

The stairs connect the servants' closet (area N4f) with the cellar (area N4s). [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] uses this staircase to reach her secret cult lair (area N4t).

#### N4h. Servants' Quarters
>The furnishing in this room are bereft of imagination: four simple beds with equally austere wooden chests.

Lady Wachter's four servants (N male and female [[Commoner]]s) sleep here at night. They include a cook named [[Dhavit]], two maids named [[Madalena]] and [[Amalthia]], and a valet named [[Haliq]]. The servants know [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s secrets, but they would sooner die than betray her.

#### N4i. Parlor
[[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] greets her guests here, under the watchful eyes of her dead husband.

>Here three elegant couches surround an oval table made of black glass. All are set in front of a blazing hearth, above which hangs the portrait of a smirking nobleman sporting a broken nose and a tangle of hair graying at the temples. Several smaller portraits hang on the north wall.

The portrait above the mantel depicts Lord Nikolai Wachter, Fiona's late husband (of whom his sons are the spitting image). The other portraits depict [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]], her sons, her daughter, and various deceased family members.

The parlor shares the fireplace with the den (area N4k). [[Ernst Larnak]] lurks in the den and eavesdrops on any conversation that [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has with the characters, so that he can advise her after they depart.

#### N4j. Dining Room
>An ornate dining table stretches the length of this room, a crystal chandelier hanging above it imperiously. The silverware is tarnished, the dishes chipped, yet all are still quite elegant. Eight chairs, their backs adorned with sculpted elk horns, surround the table. Arched windows made of a latticework of iron and glass look out onto the small, fog-swept estate.

If the characters aim to oppose the burgomaster, [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] offers them a warm meal in the dining room as a token of her support and allegiance.

#### N4k. Den
>Wood paneling, embroidered rugs, colorful furnishings, and a blazing fire make this chamber stifling. Mounted above the mantel is an elk's head. Across from the hearth, tall, slender windows look out over dead gardens.

[[Ernst Larnak]], Lady Wachter's spy, lounges here when he's not out spying on her behalf.

**Treasure.** The room contains several items of value, including a golden goblet (worth 250 gp) from which Ernst drinks wine, a crystal wine decanter (worth 250 gp), four electrum candelabras (worth 25 gp each), and a bronze urn with frolicking children painted on its sides (worth 100 gp).

#### N4l. Upstairs Hall
>A hallway with a window at each end wraps around the staircase railing. Framed portraits and mirrors festoon the walls, surrounding you with judging looks and dark reflections. You hear something scratching at one of the many doors.

The scratching noise comes from the door to area N4n, which is locked. If the characters call out, a plaintive female voice meows like a cat and says, "Can little kitty come out to play? Little kitty is sad and lonely and promises to be good this time, really she does." A closet at the south end of the hallway holds blankets and linens.

#### N4m. Brothers' Rooms
>This bedroom contains nothing out of the ordinary: a neatly made bed, a table with an oil lamp on it, a handsome wooden chest, a slender wardrobe, and a window box with drapes.

These two rooms belong to Lady Wachter's sons, [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter|Karl]]. There's a 25 percent chance that one of the maids (see area N4h) is here, tidying up.

#### N4n. Stella's Room
The door to this room is locked from both sides, and only [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has a key.

>This room is musty and dark. An iron-framed bed fitted with leather straps stands near a wall. The place has no other furnishings.
>
>Scurrying away from you on all fours is a young woman in a soiled nightgown. She leaps onto the bed and hisses like a cat. "Little kitty doesn't know you!" she shouts. "Little kitty doesn't like the smell of you!"

The young woman is [[Stella Wachter]], [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s insane daughter. A [[greater restoration]] spell rids her of the madness that makes her think she's a cat. If she is cured of her madness, she blames her mother for treating her horribly and using her as a pawn to seize control of the town. Stella knows none of her mother's secrets, apart from her mother's desire to overthrow the burgomaster. Stella has nothing kind to say about the burgomaster or his son, [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]], whose very name makes her cringe. With her wits restored, [[Stella Wachter|Stella]] feels she has no one in Vallaki she can count on. She latches onto any character who is kind to her. If the party takes her to [[#St Andral's Church (N1)]], [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] offers to look after her, and she agrees to stay with him.

#### N4o. Master Bedroom
The door to this room is locked. [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and her servants carry keys. A ghastly sight awaits those who peer into the room:

>Across from the door, a fire sputters and struggles for life in the hearth, above which hangs a framed family portrait: a noble father and mother, their two young sons, and a baby daughter in the father's arms. The sons are smiling in a way that suggests mischief. The parents look like uncrowned royalty.
>
>Wood paneling covers the walls of the room. A closet and a framed mirror flank a curtained window to the south. To the north, a wide, canopied bed lies pinned between matching end tables with oil lamps. 
>There appears to be someone sleeping in the bed

- If inspected closer:
	- The bump in the bed doesn't seem to be moving
- If the covers are pulled back:

>Stretched out on one side of the bed is a man dressed in black, his eyes each covered with a copper piece. He bears a striking resemblance to the father in the painting.

[[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s husband, Nikolai, lies in his bed, impeccably dressed, quite deceased, and under the effect of the [[gentle repose]] spell. Nothing of value is on him.

The closet contains shelves of fancy footwear and many fine garments, including a black ceremonial robe with a hood (similar to the ones worn by the cult fanatics in area N4t). On a high shelf rests a locked iron chest. [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] hides the key to the chest on a tiny hook in the fireplace, under the mantel. A character who takes a minute to search the fireplace finds the key with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Use of the key disables a [[Poison needle trap]] trap hidden in the lock. A creature that triggers the trap and fails the saving throw against the needle's poison falls unconscious for 1 hour instead of being poisoned for 1 hour.

The iron chest is lined with thin sheets of lead and contains the bones of [[Leo Dilisnya]], an enemy of the Wachter family. [[Leo]] was one of the soldiers who betrayed and murdered [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] on the day of [[Sergei]] and [[Tatyana]]'s wedding. He escaped from [[Castle Ravenloft]], only to be hunted down and killed by the vampire [[Strahd]]. The Wachters keep his bones under lock and key so that [[Leo]] can't be raised from the dead.

**Fortunes of Ravenloft.**
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is in the iron chest that contains [[Leo Dilisnya]]'s bones.

#### N4p. Library
The double doors to this room are locked. [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and her servants carry keys.

>This room is crawling with cats. Bookshelves hug the walls, but most of the shelves are bare. Other furnishings include a desk, a chair, a table, and a wine cabinet. The room has an irregular shape, and none of its angles seem quite right, as though the shifting of the house has set the whole place on edge.

Eight cats have the run of the library. These family pets have vicious dispositions, attacking anyone who tries to pick them up. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher notice that one cat has a small key hanging from its collar. The key opens the locked chest in (area N4q).

There is a 25 percent chance that one of the maids is here, dusting the bookshelves.

The cabinet holds a fine collection of wineglasses. The desk contains blank pieces of parchment, quill pens, jars of ink, wax candles, and a wax seal.

Most of the Wachter family's book collection was sold off years ago to cover debts, and the books that remain aren't particularly valuable. Use the [[Random Book Table]] table to determine the subject matter of a particular book.

A section of the bookshelf that stretches along the southernmost wall is actually a secret door on hidden hinges. The bookshelf can be pulled outward, revealing an open doorway that leads to area N4q.

#### N4q. Storage Room
>Behind the hinged panel in the bookcase lies a dusty, ten-foot-square room with a curtained window and shelves lining three walls. On the bottom shelf rests an iron chest. The other shelves are bare.

The key to the chest can be found in the library (area N4p). Use of the key disables a [[poison needle trap]] hidden in the lock.

**Treasure.** The iron chest contains several items:
- A silk bag containing 180 ep, each coin bearing Strahd's stern visage in profile
- A leather bag containing 110 gp
- A wooden pipe that has been passed down through many generations of Wachter patriarchs
- Five scrolls—notarized deeds for parcels of land given to the Wachter family by Count Strahd von Zarovich nearly four centuries ago
- A supple leather case containing an unbound manuscript titled The Devil We Know—a poetic manifesto written by Lady Fiona Wachter attesting that the worship of devils can bring happiness, success, freedom, wealth, and longevity
- A blasphemous treatise bound in black leather titled _The Grimoire of the Four Quarters_, written by the infamous diabolist Devostas, who was drawn and quartered for his fell practices yet did not die (this is a forgery; the actual grimoire would drive a reader mad)
- A very old letter to Lady Lovina Wachter (an ancestor) from one Lord Vasili von Holtz, thanking Lovina for her hospitality, loyalty, and friendship over the years

Characters who have the Tome of Strahd realize that the handwriting in Lady Lovina's letter is identical to Strahd's handwriting, suggesting that Strahd and Lord Vasili are one and the same.

#### N4r. Cellar Entrance
If the characters approach the cellar door from the outside, read:

>A slanted, wooden cellar door with an iron pull ring and iron hinges stands against the foundation of the house.

The door is unlocked. On the other side of the door are stone steps leading to a stone landing with a wooden railing. A longer staircase extends south from the landing, leading down to the cellar.

#### N4s. Cellar
>This large root cellar has a dirt floor. Two ascending flights of stone steps enclosed by wooden railings stand across from one another. Tracks in the earth lead from one staircase to the other, and other trails go from both staircases to the center of the bare west wall. Four neatly made cots are set in a row against the south wall.

Buried under the earthen floor are eight human [[skeletons]]—the animated remains of dead Vallakians that were stolen from the church cemetery (area N1) and animated by [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]. They rise up and attack intruders who cross the floor. The skeletons don't attack anyone who utters the phrase "Let the dead remain at rest" before setting foot on the floor. Only [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]], her sons, her servants, and her loyal cult fanatics know the pass phrase.

The cots are here for cultists to spend the night.

The footprints in the dirt give away the location of a secret door in the center of the western wall. Consequently, no ability check is required to locate it. The door is soundproof and pivots open on a central axis.

#### N4t. Cult Headquarters
>Flickering candles in iron holders fill this room with light and shadows. This room has a ten-foot-high ceiling and a large black pentagram inscribed on the stone floor. At each point of the pentagram rests a wooden chair. Seated in four of the five chairs are men and women in black robes with hoods: a young man who has the face of an angel; a balding hulk of a man; a squat, middle-aged woman; and a taller, younger woman with an unsettling glare. They rise to confront you.

The four people are town residents (LE male and female human [[Cult Fanatic]]s) whom [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has seduced with promises of power, wealth, and long life. They are members of her "book club," eagerly waiting for [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] to join them, read passages from her manifesto (see area N4q), and maybe conjure up a few coins. Resting on the fifth chair, quietly eavesdropping on the cultists, is the lady's invisible imp, [[Majesto]].

The cultists are gathered here in secret and attack the characters to protect their identities. They are evil Vallakians of no great importance who are tired of living in fear and poverty. Use the "Barovian Names" sidebar in chapter 2 to generate names for them, if needed.

The imp doesn't get involved in the fighting unless [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] is drawn into the conflict, in which case it fights to protect its mistress.

The pentagram is a nonmagical decoration, though [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] would have her cultists believe otherwise.

### Arasek Stockyard (N5)
>This large stockyard has several locked sheds along its periphery and lies adjacent to a roomy warehouse. A wooden sign above the front gate reads "Arasek Stockyard."

Parked at the south end of the stockyard is a sturdy carnival wagon, its colorful paint peeling off. Faded lettering on its sides spells out the words "[[Rictavio]]'s Carnival of Wonders." A heavy padlock secures the back door.

The stockyard is a general store and a facility where storage sheds can be rented. It is owned by a middle-aged married couple, [[Gunther Arasek]] and [[Yelena Arasek]]. They sell items from the [[Adventuring Gear]] table in the Player's Handbook that have a price of 25 gp or less, but at five times the price.

#### Rictavio's Carnival Wagon
The colorful half-elf bard [[Rictavio]] (see area N2 and appendix D) paid [[Gunther Arasek|Gunther]] and [[Yelena Arasek|Yelena]] a generous amount of gold to watch his carnival wagon, no questions asked. If the characters approach the wagon, read:

>The wagon suddenly lurches, as though something big has thrown itself against the inside wall. You hear the cracking of wood, the scraping of metal, and the snarl of something inhuman. Upon closer inspection, you see that the sides of the wagon are spattered with dry blood. You also see an inscription on the wagon's door frame that reads, "I bring you from Shadow into Light!"

[[Rictavio]] carries the key to the wagon door. The lock can be picked but is rigged with a ][poison needle trap] trap.

Inside the wagon is a saber-toothed tiger (see statblock below).

The wagon also contains the torn-up remains of a doll. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers that the doll was once a colorfully dressed [[Vistani]]effigy. Stitched into its tattered pants is a slogan: "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!"

[[Rictavio]] isn't ready to unleash the tiger on the [[Vistani]] just yet. He feeds it by dropping wolf steaks down a 1-foot-square hatch in the wagon's roof. A character who climbs atop the wagon can spot the hatch without needing to make an ability check.

If the tiger is released, it begins stalking through the streets until its keen sense of smell locates either [[Rictavio]] (area N2) or [[Piccolo]] (area N7). The tiger doesn't attack anyone who isn't a [[Vistani|Vistana]] except in self-defense. It attacks [[Vistani]] on sight. [[Rictavio]] can make the tiger break off its attack and lure it back into the wagon.

**Treasure.** The front seat of the wagon conceals a secret compartment that requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find and open. The compartment holds several items:
- An unlocked wooden coffer containing 50 ep bearing Strahd's profile and six gemstones (worth 100 gp each)
- A small prayer book (worth 50 gp) with a green leather cover and indecipherable notes in the margins
- A healer's kit
- Three wooden holy symbols inlaid with silver and in the shape of a sunburst (worth 50 gp each)
- A silvered shortsword
- A hand crossbow inlaid with mother-of-pearl (worth 250 gp)
- A bundle of twenty silvered crossbow bolts
- A worn leather case with gold buckles (worth 100 gp) containing three sharpened wooden stakes, a sack of garlic, a jar of salt, a box of holy wafers, six vials of holy water, a polished steel mirror, and a bone scroll tube with a silver stopper and chain (worth 25 gp). The tube contains a _spell scroll_ of _protection from fiends_ and a _spell scroll_ of _protection from undead_.

**Fortunes of Ravenloft** If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden with the other items under the front seat of the wagon, in a lead-lined box.

### Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)
>This uninviting shop is two stories tall and has a sign shaped like a coffin above the front door. All of the window shutters are closed up tight, and a deathly silence surrounds the establishment.

-  [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Vasili]] ([[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]) visited here several months ago and left vampire spawn upstairs
- Every window of [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s shop is a latticework of iron fitted with squares of frosted glass and locked from the inside.
- The outside doors of the shop are barred shut from within.
	- If the characters knock on one of them, Henrik shouts, "We're closed! Go away!" without opening the door.
	- If the characters accuse Henrik of stealing the bones of St. Andral, he shouts again, "Go away! Leave me alone!"

- If the characters break into the store, Henrik offers no resistance
	- he tells them to get out, but doesn't threaten guards (he doesn't want them to see the vamps)
- denies any knowledge of the bones
	- "I don't know what you're talking about" is said a lot
	- Decent Insight would tell the players he's lying, but he doesn't relent
- He reveals the bones are upstairs if threatened with violence or tattling
	- He doesn't say where, and he **doesn't mention the vampire spawn**
	- He also doesn't give any motives
- He digs his heels in and refuses to go upstairs
	- He never says why


#### N6a. Coffin Storage
>Arranged haphazardly about the floor of this musty, L-shaped room are thirteen wooden coffins.

- Henrik stores and displays the coffins he has made in this room
	- All of them are empty.
- The door to this staircase has a [[Glyph of Warding]] with a [[Clairvoyance]] spell attached
	- if anyone besides [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] or [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] open the door, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] can see what's going on
	- DC 18 Investigation can find the glyph (Strahd's Spell save is 18)
	- When this door is open, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is on his way!!
- When the characters open the door:

>As you open the door, a sudden draft chills your spines, and it leaves you with a very uncomfortable feeling. You feel that you're being watched.

#### N6b. Junk Room
>A table with four chairs is in one corner of this room, with a lantern hanging from a chain directly above. Two well-made cabinets stand against the east wall. Up against the wall, you see a bedroll.

- The cabinets are packed with worthless items that Henrik has collected over the years.
- [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] has been using the bedroll because he's afraid to go upstairs for the last several months because of the vampire spawn

#### N6c. Workshop
>This workshop contains everything a carpenter needs to make coffins and furniture. Three sturdy worktables stretch the length of the west wall.

- Henrik builds coffins and keeps his carpenter's tools in this room.

#### N6d. Kitchen
>This kitchen contains a square table surrounded by chairs and shelves of provisions.

- Henrik prepares his meals here.

#### N6e. Henrik's Bedroom
>This modest bedchamber holds a cot and several well-made pieces of furniture, including a table, a padded chair, a bookshelf, and a wardrobe.

- Henrik used to sleep here, at night and well into the morning
	- Investigation reveals this bed hasn't been used in months
- The bookshelf contains a handful of storybooks and carpenters' manuals that have been handed down from previous generations.

- **Treasure.** The wardrobe in the southeast corner has a secret compartment in its base, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.
	- Inside the compartment are two sacks—a large one containing the bones of St. Andral and a small one containing 30 sp and 12 ep. All of the coins bear the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich.

- if the bones are taken, the Vampire spawn next door wake up, and start making their way into the town to raise hell
	- at least one of them will try to take the bones
		- this may be a strength vs str or dex contest

#### N6f. Vampire Nest
>This large, drafty room is strung with cobwebs and takes up most of the upper floor. Stacks of wooden planks lie amid several crates marked "JUNK."

- The two southernmost crates contain old junk that Henrik has accumulated over the years
- The six crates in the northern part of the room are packed with earth and serve as resting places for the six vampire spawn that lair here
	- If the characters open one of the occupied crates, all of the vampire spawn burst forth and attack

- **Teleport Destination.** Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 in [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]] arrive at the point marked T on the map.

### Blinsky Toys (N7)
>This cramped shop has a dark entrance portico, above which hangs a wooden sign shaped like a rocking horse, with a "B" engraved on both sides. Flanking the entrance are two arched, lead-framed windows. Through the dirty glass, you see jumbled displays of toys and hanging placards bearing the slogan "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!"

Vallaki's toymaker, [[Gadof Blinsky]] calls himself "a wizard of tiny wonders," but he has been consumed by despair lately because no one seems to like him or want his toys. His fascination for eerie playthings causes most other locals to avoid him. The burgomaster enables Blinsky to stay in business by giving him a couple of gold pieces a month to make festival decorations.

[[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] is a heavyset man who wears a moth-eaten jester's cap during store hours, more out of habit than to humor visitors. In the past six months, the only paying customer who has set foot in the store is a visitor from a faraway land named [[Rictavio]] (see area N2), who came in two weeks ago and bought a stuffed [[Vistani|Vistana]] doll. Realizing that the toymaker was lonely, [[Rictavio]] gave [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] his pet monkey, [[Piccolo]] (use the baboon stat block in the Monster Manual). Overjoyed, [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] has begun training the monkey to fetch toys from hard-to-reach shelves. The toymaker has also fitted [[Piccolo]] with a custom-tailored ballerina tutu.

When he meets new customers, Blinsky recites a well-rehearsed greeting:

>Wyelcome, friends, to the House of Blinsky, where hyappiness and smiles can be bought at bargain prices. Perhaps you know a leetle child in need of joy? A leetle toy for a girl or boy?

**Creepy Toys**
[[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] believes [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]] is right—that the only way to escape from Barovia is to make everyone in town "hyappy." [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] would like to do his part by making sure that all the children in Barovia have fun toys. On display are a few of his creations:

- A headless doll that comes with a sack of attachable heads, including one with its eyes and mouth stitched shut (price 9 cp)
- A miniature gallows, complete with trapdoor and a weighted "hanged man" (price 9 cp)
- A set of wooden nesting dolls; the smaller each one gets, the older it gets, until the innermost doll is a mummified corpse (price 9 cp)
- A wood-and-string mobile of hanging bats with flapping wings (price 9 cp)
- A wind-up musical merry-go-round with figures of snarling wolves chasing children in place of prancing horses (price 9 sp)
- A ventriloquist's dummy that looks like [[Strahd von Zarovich]] (price 9 sp)
- A doll that looks remarkably like [[Elora]] (not for sale; see below)

**[[Elora]] dolls.** Blinsky makes special dolls for the burgomaster's henchman, [[Izek Strazni]] (see area N3 and appendix D). [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] doesn't pay for the dolls but instead threatens to burn down [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]]'s shop unless the toymaker delivers a new doll every month. Every doll is modeled on a description given to [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] by [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], and each doll has been closer to capturing [[Elora]]'s likeness than the last. [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] doesn't know that the doll is meant to be modeled after anyone in particular. If [[Elora]] is with the party, however, [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] realizes that she is the inspiration for [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s dolls.


**Von Weerg's Masterpiece.** [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] considers himself a student of a great inventor and toymaker named [[Fritz von Weerg]]. [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] has heard rumors that [[von Weerg]]'s greatest invention—a clockwork man—lies somewhere in [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]]. If the characters seem intent on going there, [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] asks if they would be so kind as to find the clockwork "myasterpiece" and "dyeliver" it to him, in exchange for which [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] offers to make them any toy they desire. Because "byusiness" has not been good, he says, he has no other reward to offer except, perhaps, his new monkey companion.

### Town Square (N8)
>The shops and homes that enclose the town square are decorated with limp, tattered garlands and painted wooden boxes filled with tiny, dead flowers. In the middle of the square is a large wooden platform about four feet tall. This square stage features stocks lined up around the edges and facing outward towards the rest of the town square, locked in which are several men, women, and children wearing crude, plaster donkey heads on full display. In the center of this platform is an empty gallows, a trio of nooses hanging ready and waiting.
>
>Off to the side of the square, peasants in patchwork clothes eye you suspiciously as they use cups and vases to draw water from a crumbling stone fountain. Standing tall at the center of the fountain is a gray statue of an impressive man facing west. Throughout the square, you notice guards like those at the gate patrolling the area. All around the square are posted proclamations:

- [[Old Vallaki Proclamation]]
- Most Vallakians have no idea whom the statue in the square represents. The burgomaster claims it is [[Boris Vallakovich]], his ancestor and the town's founder, but there's no noticeable family resemblance.
- Other stages off to the side for festivals
- **The townsfolk in the stocks**
	- arrested for "malicious unhappiness" (spreading negative opinions about the upcoming festival)
	- An iron padlock secures each set of stocks
	- [[Izek Strazni]] carries the keys on an iron ring
	- Three men, two women, and two boys are trapped in the stocks—all of them tired, wet, and famished
		- The five adults have the statistics of human [[commoner]]
		- the children are noncombatants
		- The plaster donkey heads they wear are meant to encourage ridicule.
	- Freeing one or more prisoners without [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s consent is a crime
		- If the characters try:
			- A townie may first try to stop them, saying they're acting like barbarians and warning of [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]
			- The patrolling guards notice
				- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] arrives quickly with 24 town [[guard]]s (twenty-four in all) and orders the characters to stop what they're doing
				- If [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s sibling is present, he notices and takes the party to come back to the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)]]
				- The party may be punished for their crimes depending on the severity
- **Townies**:
	- [[Danya Karushkin]] glares at them and tells them to get lost
	- [[Isabella Radova]] wears a strained smile and tells the party only propaganda
		- advocates the stocks and wonderous nature of [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] who keeps them safe from [[Strahd Von Zarovich|The Devil]]
	- [[Yesper Taltos]] gestures them over as he puts up posters for the upcoming festival
		- He tells of [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s strict rule in hushed, cautious tones
		- warns the party about breaking the law, for the punishments are far from just
			- Tells them he once saw [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]]'s henchman, [[Izek Strazni]] publicly chop off the finger of someone who refused to attend a festival


### Vistani Camp (N9)

### Reformation Center (N10)


## Scenario If-Thens
- **PCs openly break laws or antagonize [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] -> The guards will come down hard**
	- people would snitch if they do this in private
	- guilty until proven innocent
- **[[Izek Strazni|Izek]] sees his sibling -> He immediately recognizes them and is so excited, he freaks everyone out**
- **PCs are arrested -> [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] comes around pretty quickly**
	- If a minor ordeal: [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] will use his authority to excuse the party and try to get them to the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)|Burgomaster's mansion]] where he says they'll be safe
		- gives them a good chance to explore the mansion since they have his permission to be there
	- If not minor: he will do what he must to follow the law and keep his sibling safe
		- he's ok executing another party member that isn't his sibling
	- If the sibling commits terrible crimes: he actively betrays Vallaki
- **[[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] gets wind of PCs from spies -> she believes one of them is her messiah ([[Pelanil]] since he is a Cleric who believes in the power of light)**
	- She will go ahead and initiate her plan to overthrow [[Vargas Vallakovich|Burgomaster Vallakovich]] at the [[#Festival of the Blazing Sun]]
	- She'll try to convince the party to join her side also by lamenting what a horrible leader [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] is
- **PCs waylay the guards -> [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] retreats to [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)|The Mansion]], and they get the run of the town**
- **PCs lose their weapons -> The [[The Keepers of the Feather]] steal them back and eventually return them**
- **PCs are wanted and running -> The Martikovs will hide them in the attic/hayloft of [[#Blue Water Inn (N2)]]**
- **PCs side with [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and revolution takes place** -> [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] won't be killed, but taken prisoner, tortured, and paraded around town
	- Roll to see how many guards die in riot (describe them as being lynched by the mob)
	- [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] and [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] will be left alone, but will be public outcasts
- **PCs side with [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]** -> He asks them to find proof of [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s foul plans
	- If they do, [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] sends every guard not on gate duty to [[#Wachterhaus (N4)|Wachterhaus]] and drag her to the center of town for public execution
	- They'll be a fight at [[#Wachterhaus (N4)]]
	- The next night after [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]]'s death, her most loyal cultists will break into the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)]] and assassinate [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]
- **The party goes to the [[#Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)|Coffin Shop]] looking for bones** -> [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is alerted, and shows up within a few hours on [[Beucephalus]]
	- Makes a show of riding through town, and sets his vampire spawn (6 of them) loose on the town and the church (if not consecrated)
	- If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is safe, he's pissed
	- If she's not safe, he tries to charm her into coming with him
	- Then, at the [[#Festival of the Blazing Sun]], the public unrest boils over into full blown panic
		- A mob erupts against [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] and his men (worse than [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona's]] revolution would have been
		- [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] and [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] are lynched in the middle of town, and the mansion burned down
		- fires spread, and there is city-wide looting
		- roll to see which buildings are destroyed (and in turn which NPCs die) in the chaos
		- If the festival has already taken place: [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] calls a public meeting, and shit goes down there
		- If [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] is no longer in charge, [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] calls a meeting and explains that "Strahd's coming was all part of her prophesied purge and that sunlight would come soon."
	
	- When the dust settles, [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] takes over as Burgomaster if she's still alive
		- If not, the town remains in state of unrest
			- many will camp around the church, others will take advantage of lack of laws
 
## Battles in Vallaki
- If a guard is killed, it's grounds for execution
	- Give the guards backstories
- The guards fight intelligently
	- try their best to separate get PCs alone
	- retreat and come back when party isn't expecting them
		- e.g. middle of night
- depending on severity, arrested PCs will
	- be put in stocks
	- taken to the [[Reformation Center]]
	- or lined up for execution by hanging in public square
- if PC evades capture, they become wanted
	- bounty hunters may come looking on the road to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]

## Events
### Festival of the Blazing Sun
### The Feast of St Andral
- After either getting the bones back, or [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] destroying them, then play the Vallaki is Burning mini game
