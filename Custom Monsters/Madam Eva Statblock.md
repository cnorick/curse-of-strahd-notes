      damage.
  - name: Curse (Recharges after a Long Rest)
    desc: Madam Eva targets one creature that she can see within 30 feet of her. The
      target must succeed on a 17 Wisdom saving throw or be cursed. While
      cursed, the target is blinded and deafened. The curse lasts until ended
      with a greater restoration spell, a remove curse spell, or similar magic.
      When the curse ends, Madam Eva takes 5d6 psychic damage.
  - name: Evil Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
    desc: "Madam Eva targets one creature that she can see within 10 feet of her and
      casts one of the following spells on the target (save 17), requiring
      neither somatic nor material components to do so: animal friendship, charm
      person, or hold person. If the target succeeds on the initial saving
      throw, Madam Eva is blinded until the end of her next turn. Once a target
      succeeds on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the Evil
      Eye power of all Vistani for 24 hours."
