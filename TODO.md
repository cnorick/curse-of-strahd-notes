- Put a sarcophagus in the amber temple for [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]], but maybe it's open already?
	- Someone else came and let him into the mists
- Ezmerelda says she needs a moment before seeing her mentor again
	- and sneaks away as the group enters
- Ismark:
	- would probably have gotten worried after a few days of not hearing back
	- would have sent someone to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] to check on [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
	- would have heard from [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] that [[Pelanil]] mercy-killed her
	- most likely, he would mourn, but wouldn't blame the party when even he couldn't keep his sister safe
	- for an interesting filler to a session:
		- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] bursts into the room guns a blazing, fighting [[Pelanil]]
		- Obviously, he doesn't stand a chance
		- but you should make him seem really sad and pitiful
		- then have the emotional conversation of how he feels about losing his sister

- What happened in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]
	- At the [[Festival of the Blazing Sun]], a guard laughed and [[Vargas Vallakovich|Burgomaster Vallakovich]] had him tied to his horse and dragged behind
	- An angry mob broke out
		- everyone was on edge since the vampires attacked; the festivals didn't seem to work
	- They hung [[Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] and [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]]
	- Taking advantage of the chaos, [[Fiona Wachter]] took power
	- Half the town is burned, half the town and half the guards are dead
	- Most people are staying inside

- Figure out what to do with the werewolf kids long term
	- The kids already told [[Pelanil]] they're kinda cool with being werewolves
	- maybe they return to the den to capitalize on the political schism
	- or go off to start their own pack
	- **decision**: [[Lazlo]], [[Hans]], and [[Franz]] decide to go back to the werewolf den to attempt to take advantage of the political schism and free the other children

- place the third missing gem somewhere
	- inside the [[Heart of Sorrow Statblock]]

- [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] and [[Rictavio|van Richten]]
	- maybe run the [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] event when they take the skull back to [[Argynvostholt (Q)|Argynvostholt]]
	- or [[Rictavio|van Richten]] when [[Bardolf]] goes werewolf at night

Ireena options:
- The party comes across a grave somewhere meaningful. Strahd has buried her
	- [[The Abbot]] refused to revive her, so [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] buried her
- Strahd is able to bring her back via [[The Abbot]]
	- [[The Abbot]] convinced [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] to leave her corpse so that he could (unbeknownst to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]) sew her into [[Vasilka]]
- Can [[The Abbot]] actually bring people back to life?!
	- yes he can
	- So, maybe [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] takes [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] there to be revived [[The Abbot]] asks [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] to leave her so that he can "give [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] his heart's desire"
		- he actually uses her corpse to add pieces to [[Vasilka]]
		- and this will piss strahd off when he finds out
	- Or [[The Abbot]] reincarnated [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] into [[Vasilka]]'s shell

- Give [[Pelanil]] a dream from the [Dark Power](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/9zswmf/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_running_the_dark/) that gives him extra strength to help with damage

**Decision for Ireena**:
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] took her to [[The Abbot]] to be revived
- [[The Abbot]] tried, but the spell wouldn't work correctly ([[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s curse of never being with [[Tatyana]] stopped it from working)
- They buried her outside the church
- After [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] left, [[The Abbot]] dug her up and cut off her scalp and hair to add to [[Vasilka]]
	- he hopes that he can re-incarnate [[Tatyana]] into this body to present to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] for a wedding
