- Stay the night while Bardolf turns into a werewolf: [[Lycanthropy]]
- Go to [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]]
	- There is Belladonna root in the hut
- Someone will probably die
	- go to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] to revive them

## Bedtime with Bardolf
- There is a strange stench in the basement
- [[The Wizard of Wines (W)#W14. Wine Cellar|Cellar]]
	- DC 15 perception finds the door
	- [[Piccolo]] maybe whimpers at the door

>As you settle in for bed, you notice it's extra dark tonight, the thick fog rolling in to block out only a sliver of a waning moon visible in the sky.

- [[Bardolf]] will likely be tied to the post with an iron (AC 19) [[reference/Adventuring Gear#^b8e9c5|Chain]]: ![[reference/Adventuring Gear#^b8e9c5|Chain]]
- [[Lycanthropy]]
- He loses consciousness, but the others see him struggle against the chain and possibly break free
	- his skin bubbles and his hair spreads downward from his head
		- his hands enlarge and become huge paws
	- have him roll a strength check (secretly modified) against the chain
	- if he breaks free, he runs off at incredible speed (60 speed) towards the woods
- If others are asleep, passive perception vs his stealth
- He wakes up naked and covered in blood in the vineyard
	- {It's goat blood; he snuck into the swamp}

- [[Lazlo]], [[Hans]], and [[Franz]] decide to go back to the werewolf den to attempt to take advantage of the political schism and free the other children

## Berez
- ~3 hr walk
	- [[Raven River Crossroads (R)]]
	- Random encounter while walking: [[Random Encounters#^ea5845|False Trail]]
		- Hidden: DC 15 perception => you seen an absence of foot traffic over a section of the ground
			- another DC 15 Investigation check confirms that it's a hidden pit
		- Spiked Pit: 2d10 piercing damage from spikes + 1d6 falling damage for 10 feet depth


![[Raven River Crossroads (R)]]

- There is a handout image
- [[Ruins of Berez (U)]]
- Martikovs again warn them to be careful

### Approaching
- They approach from the north, following beside the river
- The river becomes less and less discernable as there is standing water across the whole area
- As they walk in, they have no option but to walk through swampy water up to their ankles or knees

- [[Giant Poisonous Snake]]s may poke their heads out of the water

On an average sized humanoid (about 5'6" height I'd say), the waters in Areas A and D get up to about ribcage height. The waters in Areas B and C get up to about waist height. And the waters in Area E get up to about shoulder height. The rest of Berez is filled with either ankle-deep to knee-deep water.
