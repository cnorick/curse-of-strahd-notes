- Give advantage on history checks so the group can see if they remember the model they saw in the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]]

## Final Fight

"While your escapades in my realm have been entertaining, I'm afraid I can no longer allow your crimes to go unpunished. I, Count Strahd von Zarovich, son of King Barov von Zarovich, sentence you to death." Strahd gently places his wine glass on the end table beside his chair. Then, head held high and never breaking eye contact, he rises. With a quick, steady hand, he draws his sword. "Shall we begin?" Roll initiative.

## Strategy

- [[Power Word Kill]] as an optional spell to get rid of the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]]
- Stay 30ft away from [[Misc/Campaign Items/Sunsword|Sunsword]]
	- After [[Pelanil]] moves close on his turn, use legendary move to get away right after (it might take two turns)(make sure there is a person between you in the turn order)****
- Player weaknesses:
	- [[Pelanil]]: Cha -2
		- [[Forcecage]] (cha) to trap him
		- [[Maximilian's Earthen Grasp]] (str) to hold him
	- [[Elora]] Wis 0
		- [[Thunderwave]] (con) save to push her
	- [[Shalooti]] Con -1
		- [[Thunderwave]] (con) save to push her
	- [[Anakir]] Str/Dex 0
		- [[Maximilian's Earthen Grasp]] (str) to hold him
		- [[Ice Storm]] (dex) hurts him + difficult terrain for everyone else
	- [[Bardolf]]
	- [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]]
		- [[Maximilian's Earthen Grasp]] (str) to hold him
	
- Bite a player and have them immediately turn into a vampire spawn after dying
	- They can come back to life next round after failing the death save
	- Or use Summon Spirit Lair action to turn them into a [[Specter]]

### After a round or two

- Strahd transforms into his true self and uses his claws/bite over his sword
### Halfway Through Fight

- Strahd retreats when he's like half out of HP
	- The party hears him say "join me my children"
	- so that he can regen
	- stuff in the castle will delay the party; allow them to choose to stay in initiative
	- he retreats as a mist up the stairs with the chink
	- he goes to the spires or the parapets
- From here, the party can see that Strahd's reinforcements are making their way across the drawbridge
	- Wolves, bats, and vampire spawn (more than Vallaki)
		- hundreds of baddies
		- maybe a few run into the castle, and the party has to fight them
		- let it really set in that things are dire
	- Then they see their own reinforcements:
		- A swarm of ravens flies in from the west, transforming into many familiar faces and many unfamiliar
			- it's the [[The Keepers of the Feather|Martikovs]] ([[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]]  and [[The Keepers of the Feather|Keepers of the Feather]])
			- they transform to human and block the entrance for the wolves and vamps
		- Out of the woods comes [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] with three small wolves at his heel, and a couple dozen other full-grown werewolves
			- the boys that were transformed earlier
			- Izek has been keeping an eye on them
		- From the south, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] leads a small but determined group of ragged fighters from [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]
		- More wereravens ([[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] from the winery) as well as [[Rictavio]]
		- Piccolo leading a group of little stick bois
	- Each round on initiative 20, let the party roll to see how the battle is going downstairs
		- if they do something to help during the round, give them advantage
		- They can roll whatever makes sense for their last action (e.g. dex/str for throwing something off the wall) or cha by default (to see how inspired the fighters were by the messages Pelanil sent and their previous interactions with the party)
			- use a group check:
				- To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

		- The roll is against a [[Vampires]] str roll (to represent the strength of the other side)
			- every failure means another named NPC dies

- Ritual one:
	- As a ritual, three casters must proceed with the spell for 10 uninterrupted minutes
	- summons [[Vampyr]]
- Ritual two:
	- as a ritual one caster must succeed on 3 consecutive magic checks in their spell casting ability, DC 16.
	- you can make the casting of this ritual take bonus actions instead of actions so its easier
	- the caster must be able to see Vampyr for each roll. They can't be in a different room or casting blindly in darkness. They've got to see the beast to imprison it.
	- And lastly, the ritual requires a chip of amber as a component.
