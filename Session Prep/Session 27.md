>As you carefully set the skull of Argynvost into its place within the mausoleum, a profound silence falls over the room. The air grows heavy with anticipation, and for a moment, it seems as though time itself holds its breath. Then, a brilliant light bursts forth from the skull, illuminating the mausoleum with an otherworldly radiance.
>
>The dragon's spirit coalesces from the light, a majestic and awe-inspiring form that fills the room with a sense of ancient power and unwavering nobility. Argynvost’s spectral form rises and lets out a silent roar, his brilliance piercing through the walls and shooting skyward.
>
>The light, as bright as the sun, floods through the room and shoots into the sky, cutting through the gloom of Barovia like a beacon of hope. It spreads across the valley, reaching even the farthest corners of this cursed land. Though the mountains prevent the light from reaching Castle Ravenloft directly, its glow is unmistakable in the sky to the west.
>
>For those in Vallaki, Krezk, and Berez, the beacon is a sight to behold. Everywhere the light touches, a sense of hope and joy fills the hearts of all who see it, lifting their spirits and giving them renewed strength. In contrast, the light is unsettling to those with dark intentions, a stark reminder of the goodness that still fights against the darkness.
>
>As the light reaches its zenith, you feel a warmth envelop you, bolstering your resolve. The beacon's protective magic grants you a newfound resilience, a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws as long as you remain in Barovia.
>
>The beacon of Argynvost remains, a perpetual light in the dark land of Barovia, a symbol of hope, and a promise that good can still prevail against the encroaching shadows.

- As they leave, they see that the revenants have all turned to ash
	- if Godfrey is with them, they see that he is finally free to die

- As they leave:
	- Parked outside the castle, is a large black carriage drawn by two black horses. The horses snort puffs of steamy breath into the chill mountain air. The side door of the carriage swings open silently.
