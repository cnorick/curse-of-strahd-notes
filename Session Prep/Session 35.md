- strahd in the middle of the bridge
- nighttime now, it's getting dark
- [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] and [[Rictavio]] stay outside to fight wolves? Snow caves everyone in?

- Tell them how to kill [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] in the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]] library
	- Once he is killed, he turns to mist and returns to his coffin where he regenerates
	- There, they have to perform a ritual to either:
		- summon the link to [[Vampyr]] and sever it
		- summon [[Vampyr]] himself
			- then either:
				- kill [[Vampyr]]
				- or perform a ritual to lock him in an amber shard
	- Ritual one:
		- As a ritual, three casters must proceed with the spell for 10 uninterrupted minutes
		- summons [[Vampyr]]
	- Ritual two:
		- as a ritual one caster must succeed on 3 consecutive magic checks in their spell casting ability, DC 16.
		- you can make the casting of this ritual take bonus actions instead of actions so its easier
		- the caster must be able to see Vampyr for each roll. They can't be in a different room or casting blindly in darkness. They've got to see the beast to imprison it.
		- And lastly, the ritual requires a chip of amber as a component.
