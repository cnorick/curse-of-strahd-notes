alias: Ireena
---
(LG female human noble)
## Playing Ireena Kolyana
- a striking young woman with auburn hair
- she's been bitten twice by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- because of this: the villagers are afraid of her and avoid her
- She appears mild
	- but has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself
	- has a stubborn streak and sometimes will plant herself and changing her mind becomes extraordinarily difficult
- She is one of the few truly good people in the game
	- She's scared like everyone else, but her fear has made her kind and empathetic
	- She doesn't let her fear of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] stand in her way
		- She actively works to avoid him
		- The fear motivates her
	- She comforts children, helps those in need
- loves discovering new things
- Has a sense of humor and will sometimes crack jokes (unusual in Barovia) {It's a lingering effect of [[Tatyana]]'s soul from an earlier time}
- As a noble, she shines at persuasion, deception, and insight
	- She's the only daughter of the Burgomaster and part of only three noble families
	- Give her the *Position of Privilege* feature from the noble background
		- All the commoners will bend over backwards to accommodate her if they know who she is
		- Always one level better than normal for *Attitude* (friendly, hostile, etc.)
- Being politically savvy, can help the party navigate the political mess in [[Vallaki]]
	- can execute a political scandal or disgrace individuals
- Does embroidery as it is an "appropriate hobby for a lady"
	- All her cloth items (clothes, backpack, etc.) have flourishes
	- She's really good with the needle {given time to learn, she can pick up the basics of medical care/herbalism}
		- {mechanically, let her unlock the *Healer* feat + the ability to make *Healer Kits*}
			- Not good enough to do it during combat though
- She tries to be helpful to the party and not stand in the way
	- the most actively helpful individual the party will encounter
	- when she can't keep up in a fight, she'll do other things:
		- gather expended ammo, teaching herself first aid, searching bodies for useful stuff, etc.
- She's not used to the rigors of life on the move -- especially the pace set by PCs
	- Her feet will hurt at first. She may show signs and will be grateful for kindness/help
		- But will absolutely not complain; she's good at sucking it up
- Her hair is auburn (brownish red) and is unheard of in Barovia.
	- She dies her hair black, because "red hair is unlucky"
		- {this throws off her relationship to [[Tatyana]]}
		- {all of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]' s targets have that color hair and they have died (unlucky)}
		- She has to re-dye it regularly or stand out in the crowd
- She's really pretty with high Cha and [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is jealous; if an NPC flirts to hard, they may wind up dead

## What They Want
- She wants the characters to bury her father 
	- She refuses to go anywhere "while the burgomaster lies dead on the mansion floor"
- The PCs are her best hope at protection
	- so she's willing to accompany them if they bury her father

## What They Know
[[Barovian Lore]]
- She doesn't remember her early past
- She doesn't know how she came to Barovia or where she came from
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] takes consorts on occasion
	- Doesn't know why She is special to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- Her encounters with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] are fuzzy memories (because of his vampiric charm)
	- She remembers the blazing hunger in his eyes
- Wolves and creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks
	- The burgomaster's heart couldn't stand the constant assault
		- he died 3 days ago
		- since then, there have been no more attacks
- No one from the village has been brave enough to help [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] take [[Koylan Indirovich]] to the cemetery for a proper burial
- One of the best educated in the valley, as the Burgomaster's daughter
	- familiar with the geography (have her give them the map maybe)
	- can provide info about important people in each town
	- can regurgitate Barovia history trivia without a check

## [[Tatyana]]'s Memories
- Since she has [[Tatyana]]'s soul, sometimes Tatyana's memories will come to her
	- Other reincarnates in Barovia don't have this feature
- If prompted correctly by something that reminds her of [[Tatyana]]'s life, these memories will come back
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has perfected the triggers and can do this fairly easily
 
### Examples
- By my slight re-write of canon--while they were courting, Sergei (who was a gifted warrior) took it upon himself to teach Tatyana a bit about sword play (share your hobbies with those you love, I guess?). As a result, while Ireena doesn't own a Rapier at the start of the adventure, if she acquires one later--she'll take to it like a fish to water. Again, she's not a PC...she won't explosively grow in skill the way they do. But she will be good with a rapier from the first time she picks one up.
- Ireena seems to know her way around Castle Ravenloft. This isn't a conscious awareness, but if she wants to go somewhere in the castle, she can find her way there without fail. She is not, however, aware of changes made since Tatyana's death (like all the traps).
- Ireena is drawn to strong warrior types...even if it doesn't manifest as a crush, even if the party's strong warrior type isn't male or human...she'll gravitate towards that individual (especially if she is nervous).
- At any point that is of maximum detriment to Strahd's attempts to wed her, the Dark Powers may trigger Ireena to unlock whatever memories are most likely to make Strahd's attempts blow up in his face.
- She will recognize Sergei, if she sees him in the crypts, and will unlock fragmentary memories of him.
- Because I hate the whole Krezk Pool encounter and all of the "Sergei appears and Ireena ceases to exist in favor of Tatyana" scenes...if she encounters Sergei, she will recognize him and unlock a rather large batch of memories that reveals her former identity to her. However, she continues to be Ireena, retains her personality, and must make her own decisions.
- She will feel nostalgic around the Sunsword, feeling like she recognizes the hilt.
- The view from the Overlook (Area K6 in Castle Ravenloft) is nostalgic to her, and unlocks a memory of clear, beautiful days seen from that spot. Weird, as she has never seen clear skies in her life.
- Seeing the painting of Tatyana in Strahd's study may trigger a memory of sitting for that painting.
- Seeing the dining room (and rotted cake) in Ravenloft may trigger a flashbulb of herself in a wedding dress, with the room richly decorated, and the cake fresh.

## Secrets
- She is the blood sister of [[Izek Strazni]], but neither of them know it

## Notes
- [[If Players Die]], an option would be to let them play Ireena since she will follow the group most of the game
	- For ambitious players, I can hand her over to play as well as their own character
- You could consider not making her Izek's sister, but instead one of the PCs
- After she joins the party, consider bumping up her stats only gradually ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8vsw2p/my_notes_on_running_ireena_without_making_her_a/))
	- after asking the PCs to train her
	- PCs always out class her
	- She is better at defending herself from mundane threats

## Relations
adopted brother: [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]
father: [[Koylan Indirovich]]
