## Playing Arrigal

## History/Info
- Arrigal *is* in league with Strahd, but not for the reasons you might thing.
    - Unfortunately, due to this camp's proximity to Vallaki, this particular site has received a lot of hate over the years. They've suffered horrible bigotry and persecution at the hands of the local Barovians and their relationship with the people of Vallaki is quite sour. Vistani culture dictates that they must be friendly to visitors, but they are quite cautious about Vallakians.
    - While Luvash is hardcore Vistani and sticks to the welcoming tenants of their culture, Arrigal is much more of a realist. Arrigal can't stand seeing his people unjustly persecuted and knows that such bigotry can be very dangerous under the right circumstance. In an effort to protect his people, Arrigal secretly went to Strahd and struck a deal with him. In return for Arrigal's loyalty, information brokerage, and other support, Strahd would come to the aid of this particular Vistani camp if it ever came under attack from the people of Vallaki.
    - Arrigal, like most Vistani, doesn't think too poorly of Strahd. He's an old, powerful entity and therefore garners Arrigal's respect. Thus far, Strahd hasn't demanded that Arrigal do anything particularly heinous, but uses him as a talented informant.
    - Arrigal is quick to learn what he can about the party and cuts locks of hair from each PC as they sleep if he can. Whatever he gathers, he takes directly to Strahd in the following couple days.
- A Loving Uncle
    - While Arrigal is completely loyal to his people as a whole, he loves Arabelle more than anyone. She's the only one that Arrigal will open up to and he values her wit and insights.
    - In order, Arrigal's loyalties are first to Arabelle, then to this particular Vistani camp, then to all Vistani, then to Strahd, then to the players.
