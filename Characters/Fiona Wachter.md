## Playing Lady Fiona Wachter
- Queen-like presence
	- comforting but commanding like a stern mother
	- She never raises her voice and always speaks calmly and unhurriedly
	- She listens ardently, and makes people feel important
	- very charismatic and plays into it
	- The ends always justify the means
	- Think religious Cersie Lannister from GoT

- Family:
	- Her late husband, [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]], was her world; she was married at 16
		- he was only a banker's apprentice, but she loved that he listened to her
		- Her parents made him take the Wachter name
	- She loves all three of her kids, and actually treats them well unlike many other families in Barovia
		- [[Stella Wachter|Stella]]'s fall really pains her; she blames and hates herself for not seeing the true cause until it was too late
			- She holds a personal grudge against the Burgomaster's house
	- Her beliefs come first over family

## History/Info
- **Disillusioned to the Vallakoviches' Rule**
	- Grew up under [[Boris Vallakovich]]'s harsh rule, then saw [[Vargas Vallakovich]] come to power to be just as bad
		- They did their evil deeds and abused their power in the name of protection against [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], but he was a distant non-threat in her eyes
- **Made a pact with Strahd**
	- At 15, her parents let her make a trip to [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]] for political connections, but she took a detour to [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Ravenloft]] to see what the big deal was
		- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], ever the gentleman, entertained her visit
		- He saw her potential, and offered a place among his consorts
		- She declined, saying she could be a better resource with information from [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]
		- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] agreed to the alliance, and gifted her the imp [[Majesto]]
- **The Prophesy**
	- on her way back to [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]], she stopped to meet [[Madam Eva]] and got the following fortune:
		- First, there would be the coming of an outsider to Vallaki, foreign to this land. The coming of this outsider would mark the beginning of a new age in Vallaki.
		- The coming of the outsider would also bring a great ruin. A purge on the town like none other.
		- But when the ruin was done, the blood of the outsider would shed sunlight on Vallaki yet again.
- **Her Cult**
	- She believes she is a prophet and preaches her prophesy to her followers
	- The cult follows her because she preaches of salvation from this awful world (just like any other IRL religion)
	- She sincerely believes the coming of the outsider will purge the wicked from [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] and the sun will shine on them afterwards
	- She does NOT consider it a cult
