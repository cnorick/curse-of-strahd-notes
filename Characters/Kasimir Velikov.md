## Playing Kasimir

## History/Info
- the leader of the dusk elves
- burdened by dreams sent to him by his dead sister, [[Patrina Velikovna]]
	- Her spirit has languished in the catacombs of [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]] for centuries


Kasimir believes that Patrina has repented for her many sins, and he yearns not only to free her but also to restore her to life.

If the characters seem intent on destroying Strahd, Kasimir tells them about the Amber Temple. Without divulging too much of the dreams sent to him by Patrina, Kasimir informs the characters that the secret to breaking Strahd's pact and freeing Barovia from its curse might be hidden there. Kasimir doesn't know whether this claim is true or not, but he states it as a way of persuading the characters to accompany him to the temple; his main objective, he says, is to find something there that he can use to bring Patrina back from the dead.
