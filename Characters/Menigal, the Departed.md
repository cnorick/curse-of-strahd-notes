**NAME: Menigal, the Departed**

THEME: Menigal’s appearance is that of the Grim Reaper, the harbinger of death. Menigal though cares little for those who die of natural causes but instead feeds on those who died unnaturally (combat, magic, etc). However, for part of their soul, Menigal may spare someone’s life who died unnaturally in exchange for future favors---specifically, that they assist in creating situations where more people untimely die.

**BOON:**

- Character gains Among the Dead from the Undying Warlock class
    
- Character automatically succeeds death rolls
    
- Character has advantage with attacks against humanoids with 25% or less health and if the attack would result in 3 hit points or less, the target is reduced to 0 hit points instead.
    

**BANE:**

- Daily DC 14 wisdom saving throw. On a failure:
    
    - The DM may choose that 1 attempt that day to aid/heal someone who was injured unnaturally will instead result in additional damage as Menigal intervenes to end their life instead of saving it.
        
    - The DM may choose that 1 attempt that day to attack an enemy is instead redirected to another target, including a party member, if the damage from that attack will result in that alternative target being brought to 0 or less hit points.
        
    - The DM may cause the character to force fail a Suggestion spell from Menigal, ordering the character to spare a humanoids life.
        

**PHYSICIAL APPEARANCE:**

The character begins to look older and more corpse like, with a sunken face and dark abysmal eyes.
