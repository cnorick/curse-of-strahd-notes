![[Rictavio-Token.png|200]]
## Playing Rictavio
- He wears a [[hat of disguise]] and a [[ring of mind shielding]] to conceal his identity
- He carries an iron key that unlocks the door to his carnival wagon ([[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Arasek Stockyard (N5)]])
- He is using multiple layers of fake identities:
	- He's playing a spy who's playing a carnival ringmaster
- Really over the top

## Playing Van Richten
- He's a little racist against the [[Vistani]] as he assumes they're all in league with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- If he gives the players [[The Tome of Strahd]], he warns them that they should keep it secret
	- else [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s spies will inform him, and he'll try to get it back
- Thinks things through before rushing in
- He's cursed by [[Vistani]]: "Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws."

## History/Info
- Originally a doctor
- His son Erasmus was taken from him by a [[Vistani]], given to a vampire, and turned into a vampire spawn
	- he found him eventually, and put a stake through his heart to spare his suffering
- He fled [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] after his tiger got out for fear of being hanged

## What They Want
- During his stay at [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Blue Water Inn (N2)|The Blue Water Inn]], he is quietly gathering information on [[The Keepers of the Feather]]
	- trying to figure out the identities of all the wereravens in town
- He's also trying to learn as much as he can about the [[Vistani]], particularly the ones living in the camp just outside town ([[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Vistani Camp (N9)]])
	- Once he concludes that they are in league with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], plans to unleash his trained saber-toothed tiger upon them, with or without the support of the wereravens.
- He came to Barovia to kill [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]

## What They Know
[[Barovian Lore]]
[[Vallaki Lore]]

### Monster Expert
- He knows everything about monsters: no check necessary
	- He's carrying everything monsters may be vulnerable to
	- in battle, knows what they're going to do next
- Examples of underhanded tricks:
	- Necromancer and his undead holed up in an old mansion? Bar the doors and set it on fire.
	- Vampire built his lair on low ground? Divert a river to flood the whole thing with Running Water.
	- Vampire didn't make sure his coffin was under enough layers of solid material? Blow/tear the top off and bathe the coffin in daylight.
	- Found the vampire's coffin before you go to kill it? Anyone know the spell Leomund's Tiny Hut? That'll prevent the vampire's mist form from getting back to its coffin.
	- Cave full of werewolves? Set large fires in the entrances, then cave the entrance in beyond the fire...then just wait for the fire to eat all the air out of the cave.
	- Necromancer with an army? Infect the army with Corpseblight (see my [Ezmerelda writeup](https://redd.it/8wct9k)) then put a crossbow bolt through the necromancer's throat while he struggles to figure out why his undead army is falling apart.
