## Playing Argynvost
- speak slowly and deeply like smaug

## History/Info
- Was killed by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]

## What They Want
- His broken castle fixed
- his knights returned to normal

## What They Know
- all the history of the castle
	- from the beginning of the chapter
- nothing of current events
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s soul was taken by some dark god and that is why he's a vampire (hook to the Amber Temple)
- there is some kind of ethereal corruptions in his castle
	- stemming from the darkened beacon in the highest tower
	- he's pretty sure this is why his knights have gone crazy and stuck around as undead
- doesn't know bones are in the beacon
	- doesn't know his desecrated grave is why the evil is around
	- or that [[Baba Lysaga]] stole the skull
