This deck has 13 cards. You may use an action and take a random card or several cards from above the deck.

After the result is applied, cards are returned to the deck on their own, shuffling it magically.

Forcing or tricking someone to draw a card has no effect; the Deck of Some Things only works when you know the risk and willingly take it.

To determine results, instead of using real Tarokka or playing cards, you may roll 2d12. First die determines the outcome from 1 to 12; if the result on the second die is the same as the first die, consider the result to be Joker. This enables less random deaths/bankruptcies and more fun.

## Possible results

\* = already seen once

1. * ***Five of Swords** (Myrmidon): You take 5d6 necrotic damage that ignores resistances and cannot be prevented by other means.
2. * ***Seven of Swords** (Hooded One): You take 5d10 cold damage that ignores resistances and cannot be undone by other means. If this damage reduces your hits to 0, you turn into an ice sculpture that can be thawed with open fire or spells. If you spend more than 1 minute unthawed, you die.
3. * **Nine of Swords** (Torturer): You cast a fireball spell centered on yourself, equivalent to if you cast it with a 5th level slot (DC 15).
4. ** **Five of Stars** (Elementalist): You cultivate a huge amount of roots and thorny vines around yourself. For 5 minutes, a circle with 20 feet radius around you is considered a difficult terrain.
5. * **Seven of Stars** (Illusionist): You summon a Polar bear that is charmed by you and agrees to obey your verbal commands for 1 hour. The bear becomes hostile afterwards.
6. * ***Nine of Stars** (Conjurer): You summon a Weretiger that is charmed by you and agrees to obey your verbal commands for 24 hours. Afterwards, the Weretiger may become hostile or neutral to you, depending on how you treated it in this state.
7. * (rolled <60) **Five of Coins** (Guild Member): Roll 1d100. If the result is less than 60, you lose the corresponding number of gold pieces. If the result is greater than 60, you receive the corresponding number of gold pieces. If you don't have enough gold, it's taken from a random creature within 20 yards; if it succeeds on Insight check (DC 15), the creature notices this and decides that you are to blame for the missing money. If no such creature is found either, or it doesn't have enough money, you take 3d8 necrotic damage, which ignores resistances and cannot be undone by other means.
8. **Seven of Coins** (Thief): Roll 1d100. On a result of 1 all your money and treasures, as well as the money of all creatures in a circle within 20 ft. radius of you disappear. On a successful Insight check (DC 15), the creature notices this and decides that you are to blame for the missing money. If you score 100, you gain 1 large diamond worth 1000 GP. On a result of 2-99 you receive the corresponding number of gold pieces.
9. * **Nine of Coins** (Miser): Roll 1d100. If you score 1, you lose all magical items that belong to you, even those you do not currently wear. If the result is 2-99, you receive the corresponding number of gold pieces multiplied by 10. If you score 100, you receive one Rare or Very Rare Wonderous Item of the Master's choice.
10. **Five of Glyphs** (Druid): You gain the effect of the Cure Wounds spell as if it was cast on a level 1 slot. The attribute bonus for this spell is +3.
11. *  **Seven of Glyphs** (Charlatan): You gain the effect of the Remove curse spell.
12. * **Nine of Glyphs** (Traitor): Your maximum health points are permanently increased by 1d8.
13. **Joker** (Raven): Three random cards are dealt out of the deck and their effects take effect immediately, consecutively in the order the cards appear.
