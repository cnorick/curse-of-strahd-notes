- The party went down the stairs into what seemed like soldiers' quarters
- They went into [[Rahadin]]'s office
	- in there, they found fresh ink in a journal that was logging torture
	- they saw the name [[Emil Toranescu]]
	- [[Pelanil]] found a secret door out of the office, going downstairs
- [[Anakir]] saw something move in the room as he exited
	- He slammed the door behind him and ran down the stairs, pushing aside the other party members
	- [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]] and [[Bardolf]] fell on their faces on a landing halfway down the stairs
- [[Pelanil]] ran down after them, and saw [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] coalesce from mist on the stairs below
	- [[Pelanil]] slashed at him, but the sword went through
	- [[Pelanil]] fell the rest of the way down the stairs and through the door at the bottom
	- The rest of the party just walked around the illusion of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- They found a brazier that allowed them to teleport somewhere else
	- They argued over where to go
	- [[Anakir]] threw in the stone for [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s tomb
	- The rest of the party followed
- In the catacombs:
	- [[Elora]] teleported out of the back of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s tomb
		- the rest of the crew followed
	- [[Elora]] got teleported again as she tried to find everyone else
		- she got replaced with a [[Wight]]
		- so did [[Pelanil]] and [[Anakir]]
	- Those three had to punch their way out of coffins as everyone else fought the [[Wight]]s
	- The catacombs were full of thousands of bats
- [[Pelanil]] found a weird wood and metal scepter (a musket) which he gave to [[Bardolf]]
	- he gave a wing suit to [[Shalooti]]
- [[Pelanil]] found [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] in [[Sergei]]'s tomb
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] welcomed them in and apologized they had to see him in that state
	- it is the anniversary of [[Sergei]]'s death
	- [[Pelanil]] through the [[Tome of Strahd]] at him and accused him of killing his own brother
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], in turn, accused the party of their own crimes in Barovia
	- "While your escapades in my realm have been entertaining, I'm afraid I can no longer allow your crimes to go unpunished. I, Count Strahd von Zarovich, son of King Barov von Zarovich, sentence you to death."
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] drew his shortsword and said "Shall we begin?"
